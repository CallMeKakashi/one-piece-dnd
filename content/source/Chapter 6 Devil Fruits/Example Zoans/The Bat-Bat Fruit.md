#### Using This Fruit
Upon initial consumption, you gain a +1 to your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score. When using this fruit, the user can access their hybrid and full beast form.
#### Hybrid Form
In the Hybrid Form, your attacks gain a bonus to your damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus, you have temporary hit points equal to double your level, you have a flying speed of 45ft, Echolocation, Keen Hearing, Swift Flight (see Great Bat statblock), , and teeth as natural weapons (1d8 + Str or Dex piercing).
#### Enhanced Form
When you enter your Hybrid or Full beast form, you can choose to enter an enhanced form. You gain the ability to choose to increase your size category by 1, increasing your reach by 5, and allowing you to deal 1d8 more damage. You can access this form once per long rest.
#### Endless Forms
You can now enter your full beast and hybrid form without expending a usage. You can also enter your Enhanced Form as many times per day but still costs a usage. You can also make subtle transformations, like transforming only your ears to have advantage of sound-based perception checks in your normal form.
#### Awakening
As an action, you can access Awakened Transformation. In this state,  you gain the following benefits for 10 minutes.
* You can choose to increase your size by 2 categories, increasing your reach by 10ft, and the damage dice of your weapons double.
* At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to twice your Constitution Modifier (minimum of 2)
* If you are knocked unconscious, you can continue to move around and attack, but still must make death saves.
* Your temporary hitpoints double.
* Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability scores become 18 if they weren't already higher.
After the duration of this ability, you return to your normal state with 1 level of exhaustion.
