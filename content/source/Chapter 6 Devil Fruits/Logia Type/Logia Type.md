## Logia Type

The Logia Type is considered the most powerful class of devil fruits, and some of the rarest. Logias have domain over a force of nature/element, such as light, fire, ice, and even darkness. As such they gain the ability to produce and manipulate a nigh-on infinite amount of that force.
However their most sought feature is the power of intangibility and reformation. Since logia users can transform completely into the element of their devil fruit, they become almost invulnerable to most conventional forms of damage, as their true body is now hidden under an infinite source of their element.
Even if their element is a typical solid, like steel or diamond, they can still reform if broken apart. Even decapitation or other forms of limb loss are inconsequential setbacks at best to logia fruit
users. However, this ability must be trained to be used properly as it has taken many years of training to instinctively transform into an element to avoid attacks, effectively making it so they can avoid attacks even in their sleep. However a newly made logia user, while still can transform, might not be as invincible as they would likely have to actively turn into that element.

#### Elemental Domain
As a logia, you reign domain over an element of nature such as light, metal, gas, and even swamp. You can produce a near-infinite amount of that element as an action, you can manipulate that element as part of the same action.
Most importantly, as a bonus action, you can transform your body into a limitless form of your element for the next minute. For the duration, you gain resistance to unimbued bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and any additional benefits from your specified element. These resistances can be overcome by your element's weakness. You can enter this transformation twice per long rest.
For example, if you had the Rumble-Rumble fruit, a lightning logia, your transformation would grant you the following:
* Resistance to unimbued bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. If the source is an insulator like rubber, this ignores your resistance
* Immunity to lightning damage.
* You cannot be grappled or restrained unless the source possesses armament haki or is made from an insulator like rubber.
* You have advantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws.
Simply attacking with your element is similar to using a trick. However, as logia, your tricks are more potent than most.
At 1st level, your damage is usually 2d8 or 2d10, raising by an additional dice at 5th, 11th, and 17th level.
You can spend a fruit usage to make more potent use of your fruit.
Lasting effects of your fruit last 1 minute.
#### Improved Elemental Domain
At 5th level, you gain more control over your element, The lasting effects of your devil fruit now have a duration of 10 minutes, and specifically the ability to transform into your element. Your transformation now lasts 10 minutes.
When you gain this again at 10th level, you gain immunity to unimbued bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage passively. These apply even when you are unconscious unless you are being affected by Ocean's Scorn. You can also have an amount of active devil fruit effects equal to your proficiency bonus.
At 15th level, you are better suited to avoid even imbued attacks. As a reaction, you can expend a Fruit usage to gain resistance to one source of imbued damage.
At 20th level, you have mastered the flexible and reflexive transformation of your devil fruit. You can use your reaction from 15th level without expending a usage, and you instead can gain immunity to one source of imbued damage when you do so.
