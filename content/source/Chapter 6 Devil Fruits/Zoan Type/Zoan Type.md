## Zoan Type

All zoan type fruits grant the user the ability to shapeshift into the form of a specific animal, either as a full beast or a hybrid form of the beast and their original body.
In beast form, a zoan type inherits all the strengths and weaknesses of the animal side, while in hybrid form they mix the power of their bestial side with the bipedal form of their human side. Most zoans give the user natural weapons, such as the horns of a bull. For the sake of simplicity, any zoan weapon counts as both a natural weapon and unarmed strike.
There are various animals that zoans can transform into, such as various species of cats with regular zoans, extinct species such as dinosaurs with ancient zoans, and dragons from myth with mythical zoans.

#### Ability Score Increase
Upon eating the fruit, your choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score increases by 1.
#### Hybrid Form
As a bonus action, you can expend a devil fruit usage to transform into your Hybrid Form, taking the shape that takes the best attributes of both your original body and the beast that now inhabits you. Your transformation lasts up to 10 minutes. This duration increases to 1 hour at 5th level, 8 hours at 10th level, 24 hours at 15th level, and unlimited at 20th level. This transformation ends early if you are killed, or if you end it as a free action.
While in Hybrid Form, you gain the following benefits:
* When you enter the transformation, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level (double for regular and carnivorous zoans, triple for ancient zoans, and quadruple for mythical zoans).
* All of your attacks deal an extra amount of damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
* You gain any other features from your beast such as natural weapons, enhanced senses, multiple limbs, movement speeds, etc.
* You can speak to other animals of your species. You can still speak your regular language in this form.
> ##### Transforming for Roleplay
> In the event a player wants to display their zoan transformation for purely roleplay value, such as a brief display of their power to show they are a devil fruit user or just for a comedic display, characters with devil fruits should be able to do so without costing one of their devil fruit resources.

#### Full Beast Form
As a bonus action, you can expend a devil fruit usage to transform into your Full Beast Form, taking the form of the wild beast that inhabited the fruit you consumed. Your transformation lasts up to 10 minutes. This duration increases to 1 hour at 5th level, 8 hours at 10th level, 24 hours at 15th level, and unlimited at 20th level.
While in Full Beast Form, the following rules apply:
* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Full Beast Stat Block you gain from the fruit, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. The creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block. If your physical stats are higher than that of your beast form, you can choose to retain them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. The hit points of the form scales with your level. For normal and carnivorous zoans it is calculated as (5 x your level) + your Full Beast’s Constitution modifier. For ancient zoans it is calculated as (6 x your level) + your Full Beast’s Constitution modifier.  For mythical zoans it is calculated as (7 x your level) + your Full Beast’s Constitution modifier. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in Full Beast Form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
* You can speak to other animals of your species. You can still speak your regular language in this form.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. Your equipment changes size or shape to match the new form.
<p></p>
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. For example, using Extra Attack, Unarmored Movement, Strong Will, Rage, Experimental Medicine, etc.
* Depending on the form, your ability to fulfill the somatic components of creations, use certain equipment like shields, or take actions that require the use of hands may be limited to the DM’s discretion, though through training this limitation may be overcome.
#### Enhanced Forms
At 10th level, you gain access to a more powerful hybrid form. As a bonus action, you can spend a Devil Fruit usage to access an Enhanced Form Choose either your Hybrid Form or Full Beast Form. You gain the benefits of that chosen form, with a few additional benefits:
* You can choose to have your size increase by 1 size category, doubling your dimensions and multiplying your weight by 8.
* Your reach with your attacks increases by 5ft.
* Your attacks deal an extra 1d8 damage.
This form lasts 1 hour, and you regain this ability at the end of a long rest.
#### Endless Forms
Transforming into your base Zoan Forms no longer costs a fruit usage. You can now access your Enhanced form as many times per day as you need, but it still costs a devil fruit usage.
In addition, you can alter your appearance to appear that of your beast form. For example, turning only your arm into a hoof to use the natural weapons, or transforming only your nose to enhance your perception checks.
