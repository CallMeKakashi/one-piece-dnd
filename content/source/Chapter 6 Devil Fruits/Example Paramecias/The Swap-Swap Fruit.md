#### Using this fruit
Using this fruit requires multiple steps before the main activation can take place. First, the user must use their action, or bonus action, to assign a number of objects or creatures they have touched equally to their proficiency bonus. All of these must be of small size.
As a bonus action, action, or even reaction, you can spend one of your fruit usage to swap the placement of the two objects/creatures. There is no limit on distance. Once you have spent that use, you can keep swapping those two objects without expending a use. However, attempting to swap another assigned object/creature will require a fruit usage. If you are attempting to swap an unwilling creature, they can make a Wisdom Saving Throw equal to your Devil Fruit DC to prevent the effects on success (for balancing purposes).
There are many ways to use this fruit in and out of combat. Use it to steal stuff by merely touching it, or even fire anything as a projectile.
#### Size Limit Increase
Through training, you have learned how to swap bigger and better things. At 5th level, you can now assign Medium sized objects and creatures. At 10th, Large. At 15th, Huge. The same swapping rules still apply.
#### Size Limit Break
You have reached your peak, but you can expend more energy to go further. At 20th level, you can now assign Gargantaun-sized objects and creatures. However, you can also assign bigger objects, like a Colossal ship. To assign and swap something of that magnitude, would require multiple usages which the DM can determine depending on the size of the object.
#### Awakening
The awakening of the Swap-Swap fruit has to be a little creative as it already affects the surrounding environment, and can also affect the user's body. In awakening, it extends the range of abilities. As a reaction, when one of your assigned item/creature is touching another object/creature that is of a size you can assign, you can expend a fruit usage to transfer the assignment to that object/creature, allowing you to swap them.
For example, you assign a projectile and fire it at the enemy from a distance farther than touch. Once it hits, you can transfer the assignment to them. Then, swap them with another object/creature.
