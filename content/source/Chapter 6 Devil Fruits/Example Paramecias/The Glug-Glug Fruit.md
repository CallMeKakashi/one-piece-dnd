#### Using this fruit
There are many ways to utilize this fruit. One of the main uses would be to fling alcohol as a ranged attack. It could be used to fire a single blast (much like a firebolt that scales as you level, but with bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage), or even multiple blasts (like eldritch blast).
Another benefit of this fruit is that it renders the user immune to alcohol, thus granting the creature immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
More complex uses of the fruit, such as creating a Booze Elemental, alcohol poisoning/forcing a character drunk by inflicting the poisoned condition, or using alcohol to numb the pain of any incoming attacks (granting resistance), would use up a fruit usage as a bonus action.
Lasting effects of your fruit last 1 minute.
#### Lasting Buzz
The lasting effects of your devil fruit now have a duration of 10 minutes.
#### Potent Alcohol
The effects of and the control over your alcohol become stronger. For example, you can now utilize alcohol to create a watery sphere of alcohol to drown people, or any Booze Elemental deals more damage.
#### Double Shots
You can have two effects from your fruit happen at the same time. For example, you can have 2 Booze elementals at once, or even have 1 Booze Elemental and 1 Watery Booze Sphere.
#### Hot Shot
Your control over booze allows you to do more with your fruit, without wasting uses and making the abilities that do use usages stronger. For example, something simple like creating an oil slick from alcohol no longer needs a usage.
#### Awakening
You, as a bonus action, can transform the surrounding area into alcohol, spending a devil fruit usage. Essentially by transforming that area into liquid, but also granting you a means to make big attacks or uses with your devil fruit without expending a usage.
> ##### Devil Fruit Party Ratio
> Small, but important note, it is highly recommend to not give the players too much devil fruits as it is important to have at least half the party be able to swim and not be affected by seastone.
>
> Ideally half of the total players would be devil fruit users (not counting crew NPCs, but it should also be known that not every NPC should have a devil fruit either). This note is towards both the DM and the players.
