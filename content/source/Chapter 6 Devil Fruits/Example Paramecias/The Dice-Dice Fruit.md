#### Using this fruit
As a bonus action, you can spend one of your fruit usages to roll a 1d(Insert Total Number of Devil Fruits in Universe). Whatever number is rolled, the user gains the abilities of that specific devil fruit for 1 minute, even ones that already have users. If they roll their own fruit, they get to pick a previous number they've rolled. You can only have 1 devil fruit active at a time. Due to the random nature, you only really get the 5th level benefits of the fruits (so no permanent condition and damage immunities if you roll a logia).
#### Extended Duration
At 5th level, your devil fruits now last 10 minutes.
#### Double Dice
At 10th level, you have trained hard to improve your mastery over chance. As a bonus action, you can expend two devil fruit uses to gain the effects of two different devil fruits at once that you have rolled.
#### Taken Odds
At 15th level, you've made a realization. You've seen one devil fruit, you've seen them all. At this point, you can now gain the 10th level abilities of each devil you rolled instead of the level 5 abilities (so yes to permanent condition and damage immunities for logias).
#### Triple Threat
At 20th level, you have mastered chance, allowing you to roll more dice at once. As a bonus action, you can expend 3 devil fruit uses to roll 3 times and gain the abilities of all 3 devil fruits.
#### Awakening
Ever since you've eaten this fruit, you've taken a chance. A chance to extend your abilities in wacky, random, and unpredictable ways. However, sometimes to succeed in the gambles of life, you must take a chance on others. When you expend a devil fruit usage as a bonus action to roll a random devil fruit, instead of giving it to yourself, you can give it to other people within a 60ft radius of yourself.
When you give a creature a devil fruit, they gain the Ocean's Scorn feature if they already don't have it. If you give it to a creature who already has a devil fruit, they gain the benefits of both.
If at this point you have the features of Double Dice and Triple Threat, you can divide the fruits in any way you wish. For example, rolling three fruits, you can give one to yourself, and two to your ally, or give all three to your allies split between them.
> ##### DM's Note
> To use this fruit in a game, you would likely need to compile a big list of preexisting devil fruits, and would also require some improvisation skills when determining the abilities (or spend days making devil fruit tables for everyone). It is also important to know the possibilities that this fruit opens up, much like the Deck Of Many Things. For example, what if on your list there is a devil fruit that lets you create crystals? What is stopping the user from creating diamonds for the next 10 minutes? Or even during a big boss battle, the user could get a powerful devil fruit, like the Tremor-Tremor Fruit from Whitebeard, the Fish-Fish Fruit Model: Azure Dragon from Kaido, or even the Dark-Dark Fruit from Blackbeard.
