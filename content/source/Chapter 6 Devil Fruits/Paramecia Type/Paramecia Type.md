## Paramecia Type

Paramecia type fruits are the most common and the broadest categorization of devil fruits, as it entails all forms of
superhuman abilities and traits, both physical and mental. Some paramecia devil fruits allow the user to transform their body into different substances, such as becoming heavy or blades. Other paramecia devil fruits allow the user to create specific substances such as wax or soap, or a force like shockwaves or magnetism.
When a devil fruit cannot be classified as a logia or zoan type, it is a paramecia type. While some paramecia fruits allow the user to transform parts or even their whole body, they do not infer the same immunities to damage that logia fruits do. The same goes for paramecia fruits that allow the user to generate a substance, but not transform into it. This table lists out how fruits generally get stronger as the player gets stronger (initial consumption grants only upgrades from 1-3, after training is set to the actual level) This can be altered depending on the ability.

> ##### Why So Empty?
> Most of the spaces will be empty as each devil fruit works differently, and that is up to the DM and player. I would keep those blank as it is up to the characters to determine what they do with the fruit. For example, Luffy had to discover Gear Second, it was not just handed to him. Encourage players to be creative, as the DM, you could add other supplementary abilities depending on the fruit. These abilities may even have their own resource separate from the main devil fruit uses. See the Ability Crafting suggested ruling for more.
#### Fruit Uses
Certain abilities of paramecias require the expending of a devil fruit usage. Luckily for you, paramecias get an extra usage by default since they will be using it much more than Zoans and Logias.
An example of a situation where a player would expend a usage would be. if they had the Spring-Spring fruit. Let's say a player wants to use their fruit to fling themself a far distance using their spring powers, which would not cost a fruit usage. Large attacks, like Spring Hopper, would likely use a full fruit usage as that would be essentially a powerful, charging, melee attack. Situations, where you wouldn't use a fruit usage, would be simple and arbitrary things such as simple, spring-powered punch.
#### Improved Usage
Improved Usage of Devil Fruits typically results in additional abilities related to the fruit. For example, you have a devil fruit that allows you to bring anything you draw into existence. Improved Usage could be that you can have two drawings active at once instead of just one.
Improved Usage at higher levels could follow a similar line of thinking, like instead of having 2 active effects, you can have 3 active effects.
> ##### Special Paramecias
> While not confirmed what they exactly are in canon, it can be assumed that these fruits are essentially fruits that act very similar to Zoans and Logias, but with an additional twist that makes it seem more like a Paramecia.
>
>For example, the Mochi-Mochi fruit is essentially a Mochi Logia, but due to it not being a naturally occurring substance, it is not able to be classified as a logia. How about something like. the Egg-Egg fruit? It is essentially a zoan with multiple forms and a strange conditional activation. Both these fruits, at least in terms of this homebrew, can be classified as Special Paramecias.
>
>Another example I would also like to bring up is the Roulette-Roulette fruit, a devil fruit that grants you a random devil fruit power. That would also be a special paramecia as it gives you abilities of the other 2 categories.
