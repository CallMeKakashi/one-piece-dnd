## Creating A Devil Fruit

Due to the infinite possibilities, it is difficult to create a concrete rule set, but I believe this one works just fine. It is mainly based on inferences gained from Rustage's One Piece D&D game.
When a creature consumes a devil fruit, they gain a few default abilities. They gain, Devil Fruit Uses, Ability Check, Attack, and Fruit-Fruit DC
#### Devil Fruit Uses
Similar to features such as Ki points, Devil fruits have a set amount of uses, but that only applies to major abilities. For example, Luffy accessing Second Gear would use up a Devil Fruit usage, but not something passive like his immunity to being bludgeoned, or basic actions such as punches that merely increase the range of his unarmed strikes.
If the user is a player, the gain uses based on their level (gaining an additional use every odd level), however, Paramecia types get an additional usage.
If the user is an NPC, then that's up to the DM. Typically, they would have similar uses and flexibility like a player, or even specified abilities that have a certain amount of uses that increase as the party levels up.
Activating a devil fruit ability typically takes a bonus action or an action, but can also be used as a reaction depending on the fruit. For instance, Zoans use a bonus action to go into hybrid form, some Paramecia fruit abilities require a full action, and Logias that are untrained can use their reaction to become intangible.
When a devil fruit user completes a long rest, they regain all their devil fruit uses.
#### Devil Fruit Ability Check, DC, and Attack
This mainly applies to paramecia and logia type abilities, but may also apply to some zoans. You use these when you attempt to use your devil fruit. Here are some examples:
You have the Chop-Chop Fruit, and you need to lift a boulder. You can either use Athletics or use your Devil Fruit instead, not costing a Fruit Usage. If you have the option to add expertise to a skill, you can choose to add it to your devil fruit skill. This mostly applies to passive bonuses.
You have the Flare-Flare Fruit, and you use the Fireball creation. The DC is your Fruit-Fruit DC.
You ate the String-String fruit and you want to fire a powerful string attack at a creature like a bullet. You would roll a Devil Fruit attack.
