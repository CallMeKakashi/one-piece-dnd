## What Are Devil Fruits?

Devil fruits are a mythical group of magical fruits that give you special powers, at the cost of your ability to swim, when you consume them.
#### Feature: Ocean's Scorn
Consuming a devil fruit instantly grants a character this feature. The creature permanently loses any swimming speed it may have, and it cannot benefit from any creation or effect that'd grant it a swimming speed.
When a devil fruit user is partially submerged in running water above its knees, it suffers disadvantage on all strength and dexterity ability checks, and cannot activate any devil fruit abilities until contact is broken.
If the water additionally reaches its waist, it additionally has its speed reduced by half, and suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until contact is broken.
If a devil fruit user is submerged in water beyond their waist, it becomes paralyzed until moved onto dry land, and immediately begins sinking at a speed of 30 feet per turn until it reaches the bottom.
If they have the means to breathe underwater, that still applies, such as a respiration device, or being a fishman. However, you still are subject to all the debuffs when directly submersed.
When in contact with seastone, similar effects occur. Weapons tipped with seastone will inflict knee deep weaknesses on a failed Constitution DC 20 save until the end of their next turn, or until contact is broken if the source is stuck to the target, such as a bullet or grappled. Much larger quantities of seastone, say being bound in solid sea stone handcuffs grants waist-deep weakness.
#### Feature: Awakening
Though the conditions are still as of writing this unknown, it is possible to awaken your devil fruit, enhancing one's abilities.
For Zoans, this involves gaining an additional transformation, one that greatly increases the user's size, strength, and speed, and even gives them a regeneration factor. Awakening a mythical zoan has shown that their abilities in particular awaken, not so much their form.
For Paramecias, the range of the ability increases, though this may not exactly work for all fruits. For a few real in-story examples, Doflamingo's string fruit allows him to create and manipulate string, and his awakening was to turn stuff permanently into string. Law's surgery fruit allows him to create a room to manipulate space, and his awakening allowed him to place a room on his sword, rather than surrounding himself.
For Logias, the true extent has not been revealed, but some implications Awakened Logias can change the climate, or rather can manipulate the nature of their element with an area, which would last long after the user's death. For example, Punk Hazard. Also, very likely similar to other producer paramecias.
From a game and narrative standpoint, it is best to give out Awakenings in times of great character growth and relevance, and not just handed out at a certain level.
