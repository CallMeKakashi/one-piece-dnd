### Using This Guide

This goes out to all my fellow Dungeon Masters out there. If you do want to use this system and play One Piece 5e, you must keep 2 main factors in mind. The first is that the best *One Piece* game reflects the actual series in that you will be in here for the long con. A slow drip of the plot as your party sails through ocean blues.
For games to be successful, I have found through using this system, high fantasy and focus on characters separate by arcs have been most effective in creating a fun narrative that captures the true essence of the _One Piece_ world.
Later on, in this guide there will be a few chapters on items and additional powers, essentially acting as rewards for the players. Try your best to balance out the party dynamic, and play to each player's strength. A key component to a competent Dungeon Master is flexibility and learning. Building the world to grow around your players can be key.
Please do not be alarmed by the strength of some of the class features as the guide is not meant to mesh with regular 5e, a common thing I see from veteran Dungeon Masters is that they believe that all the higher-level abilities are too strong. I agree, but looking back at games like Pathfinder, we found that there was a balance in that system.
A balance that essentially boiled down to, nothing is broken, if everything is broken. This is where an adaptable DM is essential. For example, for every encounter I plan, I play test the characters, to ensure they get the best experience possible. I don't play as myself, but rather as them and how they would play their characters.
If I get caught off guard, that is fine, continue and improvise. I do advise against a common pitfall of railroading. The best way to avoid this is by practicing adaptability and communicating with your players to agree.
Haki itself is also more reward-based but requires the party to at least be level 8 to achieve it. Haki will be described more in-depth, but know that it is not as strong as other systems I've seen. Most haki systems use Haki Dice. While it does make sense to the canon, it would destroy the balance. Too much damage means I have to increase the hit points every level, too many hit points means I have to buff the magic, and so on. So to avoid that nightmare, haki is mostly based on a proficiency bonus.
With all that said and done, I hope you all enjoy this system and have fun sailing the blues in search of your treasures.
> ##### Recommendation: Higher Power Play
> Do not be fooled by this system's label of 5e. The content presented in this guide is meant to be self-contained, and typically doesn't mix well in regular 5e, as the *One Piece* world, like most shonens, has high power scales.
>
> In my experience in utilizing this guide, the best way to run this world is high fantasy, specifically in "magic items". Magic items in this world are more or less referring to anything special. For example, a longsword that does 1d10 base and 1d12 when two-handed, devil fruits, additional powers listed in a later chapter, and weapons that can deal 2d12 (Like the Bad News from Critical Role). It is best to spread these awards out across the game, getting better and better with each arc. Because of this, it is recommended a special rule below to allow certain builds to not be outshined in higher power play. Remember, you are the DM, do not feel peer pressured to follow these rules, I am speaking from personal experience.
>
> Some of the class abilities, additional powers, and feats can increase the damage dice of an unarmed strike by 1 size, however, the cap is presented as 1d12. Some characters may gain weapons that can deal large amounts of damage, so to prevent characters that focus on unarmed builds from being left in the dust, one rule could be extending the limit,  increasing can now reach a maximum of 2d8 instead of 1d12; 1d12 => 1d14 => 2d8; because other martial classes in a higher powered game might also get weapons that do big damage dice, or deal extra elemental damage, essentially allowing the players who wanna do an unarmed strike build be on par with the rest of the players.
