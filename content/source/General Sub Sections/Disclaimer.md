# Preface
The world of *One Piece* has always been fascinating due to its endless diversity, fun power systems and battles, and compelling stories from every character. The possibilities are near endless. This had combined with a second love of mine, that being *Dungeons and Dragons*, specifically 5th edition due to it being the most popular, and the system I was most familiar with.
The overall simplicity of the system and the possibilities of *One Piece* gave rise to some inspiration. That being to run my own 5e game in the *One Piece* world. Eager, I searched for any hints on how to run things such as devil fruits, new classes, and the like. That was when I came across u/MrSilver's original 5e book. It had so much to offer, but still was lacking. However, this did not deter me from my endeavors to run _One Piece_ 5e game, so I instead began planning the world and characters.
Months down the line, I would discover a D&D 5e podcast that was also about *One Piece*, that being One Piece D&D by [Rustage](https://www.youtube.com/c/rustage), [Tekking101](https://www.youtube.com/c/tekking101), [2Spooky](https://www.youtube.com/c/2SpookyChannel), [Lost Pause](https://www.youtube.com/c/LostPause), and [Briggs](https://www.youtube.com/c/AllDayAnime). The devil fruit system made by Rustage, and how much fun the players were having brought back that motivation I needed.
So began the journey of making the system more like *One Piece*. Using some newfound ideas from Rustage, the original guide by u/MrSilvers, and some knowledgeable friends along the way, we began crafting this guide, adding new content whenever the need came up, bringing us to where we are now. As of writing this preface, I have been DMing my One Piece 5e game for a little over half a year, and so far, it has been a blast, the joy my players have when they progress through the hardships of the world is what this guide is for.
