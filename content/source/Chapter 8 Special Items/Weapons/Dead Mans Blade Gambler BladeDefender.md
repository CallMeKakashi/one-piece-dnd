### Dead Man's Blade (Gambler Blade/Defender)

This melee weapon was once wielded long ago by Captain Bill of the Wild Pirates, they say it bestowed upon him bountiful luck in combat, but not without cost. When he used it, he was more likely to hit, but it seemed misfortune in battle gravitated towards him, sealing his fate.
When you make your first attack using this weapon, you can choose a mastercraft bonus of +1 to +3. This sword gains that bonus to its attack and damage rolls as it increases your fortune in battle.
However, for each point of bonus, you choose for the sword, you take a corresponding penalty (−1 to −3) to your AC until the start of your next turn.
**Curse Overcame.** If a wielder of this weapon can overcome the curse of the blade, the blade halts its misfortune, and instead greatly awards the user.
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain +2 to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.
