### Prosthetic Limb

Limbs are lost all the time at sea, especially in large-scale naval battles between massive crews. Luckily, science has enabled those who have lost their limbs to regain their previous function.
This item replaces a lost limb a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can't be removed against your will. It detaches if you die.
