### Boots of Speed

This pair of boots are equipped with an apparatus that allows for propulsion. While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.
When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes charge, the effect ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
