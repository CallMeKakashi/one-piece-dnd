### Travel Time

Throughout the various games I have seen replicating _One Piece_ seem to have different views on distance and time between islands.
The ocean is gigantic, even more so in the _One Piece_ world. Islands, depending on their size, can take as little as an hour or days to travel around when on foot. Though this all can depend on which sea the crew is sailing in.
#### Travel By Sea
Within the North, South, East, and West Blue, the oceans reflect real-world oceans mostly. Islands are likely closer together, and travel via compass is faster as you can go to specific islands. In these seas, it would likely take only a few days to get to nearby islands, rarely over a week unless the islands are far, or if there is a storm blocking the way.
When traversing the Grand Line and New World are when travel time starts to increase. With Log Poses, they need time to update their magnetic pull. This can be as little as a day, or as long as a full year in the case of Little Garden. For simplicity, I've made it so the average time for a log pose to update is 2d6+2 days, though you can choose a specific length of time if you deem it necessary. In these seas, the duration of travel between nearby islands is at least a week, and at most a month.
