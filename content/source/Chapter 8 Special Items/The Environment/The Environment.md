## The Environment

The environment is critical to any tabletop RPG. Without it, the players are in a vacuum, separate from any sense of space and time, they just exist. Some DM's seem to forget how big, unique, and chaotic the world can be, especially when the party reaches locations such as the Grand Line and New World.
