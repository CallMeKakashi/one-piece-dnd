### Natural Obstacles

The Grand Line and New World are full of many forms of obstacles, from natural disasters to terrain hindrances, and such. Here are a few examples of how to run such natural obstacles: The range, DC, and damage of the effects may be increased depending on their severity.
#### Whirlpools
Whirlpools function much like the Whirlpool part of the Control Water creation, DC 15, Strength Saving Throw.
#### Tidal Waves
Tidal, much like Whirlpools, functions much like the Tidal Wave creation, DC 15, Strength Saving Throw. If it is truly a titanic wave, consider the Tsunami creation.
#### Storms
Storms are difficult to wade through, requiring the navigator or helmsmen to make a Navigator's Tools or Water Vehicles tool check, DC 15. On a failure, the ship and the crew may take some 2d8 bludgeoning damage.
Lightning can also accompany the storm. Roll a d100. If the number is 50 or higher, lightning strikes an area within 10ft of a creature on board. If the number 85 or higher, one of the crew members is struck by lightning, Dexterity Saving Throw DC 15 for 8d6 lightning damage.
#### Reverse Mountain
Reverse Mountain is a brief encounter that the party will experience when they sail from one of the Blues to the Grand Line. When the crew sails, they'll make a Strength Saving Throw, DC 15. On a failed save, they take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half the damage.
#### Magma
Getting splashed by magma would 4d10 fire damage. Wading through magma would be 10d10. Swimming through magma would be 18d10 fire. Magma ignores resistance to fire damage and treats immunity to fire damage as resistance. This change is made to reflect the absolute destructive properties of magma in the _One Piece_ world.
> ##### Downtime Sessions
> Do not be afraid to have sessions with little to no combat or plot action. This applies to all tabletop RPGs, you are never going to be fighting 24/7. Sometimes the best sessions are the ones where nothing but roleplay happens.
>
> This is especially true for sessions that come after big moments such as the defeat of a main antagonist, a particularly hard battle, and such.
>
> The vast oceans of the _One Piece_ world provide more than ample time for this to happen, even when waiting for a log pose to update can roleplay-focused sessions can occur.
