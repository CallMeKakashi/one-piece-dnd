### Cursed Items

Items that are cursed are a rather curious reward as the wielder must work hard to bring forth the true strength of the cursed item.
Most cursed items are weapons, and how to rule them has already been covered in this book in Chapter 8, but they can also take the form of armor, jewelry, and anything else.
Essentially, the cursed item has an ability that can either debuff the wielder or the target, usually based on a certain saving throw, DC determined by the DM. In addition, most cursed items refuse to part from their wielder, such as a sword that seems to always reappear on the person no matter how far they run, or a set of armor you cannot take off. These cursed objects can still be affected by the Remove Curse creation in the Bard and Savant spell list.
For example, let's say you wanted to create a weapon like Enma, that drains the haki, as well as physical strength from their wielders. At the start of each combat, the wielder will have to make a Wisdom Saving Throw against the DC of Enma. If the wielder fails, their strength score is reduced by 4 points and they lose the benefits of their Armament Haki features until they finish a short or long rest. If the wielder succeeds, the damage they deal with their haki is doubled and their critical hit range increases by 1. The wielder will keep making this Saving Throw at the start of each combat until the DM determines that the wielder has surpassed the curse, typically when it best fits the story.
Cursed items can also function much like the previously mentioned Staged Magic Items, though each stage has a cursed effect to overcome.
Cursed items can be found anywhere, the far back corner of stores, locked away in a treasure hoard, or even wielded by an enemy.
