### Reward Guide

For some DMs, it may be difficult to track how many non-item rewards you give to your players. Below is a table to help guide how many rewards a player should get. These rewards include Additional Powers and Devil Fruits, but not haki as each player should get haki at around the same pace, or Boons. The table describes how much awards should be recieved per tier of gameplay. As a reminder, this table is a guideline and doesn't have to be strictly followed.
Devil Fruits and Additional Powers that scale/are super impactful count as 1. Additional Powers that are smaller in nature count as between 1/5 to 4/5 of a scaling additional power.
##### Rewards Guide
| Tier | Awards |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tier 1 (1-5) | 1 |
| Tier 2 (6-10) | 2 (3 in total) |
| Tier 3 (11-16) | 3 (6 in total) |
| Tier 4 (17-20) | 4 (10 or more in total) |
#### Tiers of Play
Some DMs may have trouble gauging how strong their players should be based on the location. The *One Piece* world is built to be a linear story, broken up into several sections of increasing difficulty and dangers. Below is a good measure for each tier.
**Tier 1 (Levels 1-5)**: Players of this tier typically begin their journey within one of the Four Blues. Typical foes within these seas involve petty and upcoming pirates, low ranking marines, and a few small seakings. Devil fruit users in this part of the game are few.
**Tier 2 (Levels 6-10)**: Players of this tier begin their transition from the Four Blues to the Grandline. Not immediately deadly, but risk is involved as powerful foes such as the Seven Warlords begins to pop up, and the Marine presence has increased dramatically. Conflicts may take you under the deep ocean, or high in the clouds, with adventures spanning multiple islands. It is around this time when the party starts developing haki at 8th level, and even encountering enemies with low level haki. World Government agents may also start making moves.
**Tier 3 (Levels 11-16)**: Players of this tier find themselves at the tail end of the Grandline and the start of the New World. Here is when the conflicts start becoming more intense and even more complicated. Enemies include some of the highest ranking marines, more powerful and influential Warlords, pirate alliances, and the influence of the Four Emperors of the Sea. Conflicts involving the revolutionary army may even come up.
**Tier 4 (Levels 17-20)**: Players of this tier are deep within the New World, not just physically, but also conflict wise as the group sails towards the final island and the discovery of the One Piece. Being in their tier means one of two things, either you defeated at least one of the Emperor's of the Sea, and maybe even became one. Around this point is also when characters approach mastery of their haki, techniques, and maybe even their devil fruits. A new king will soon be crowned.
