## Rewards

Rewarding your players when they accomplish big tasks is paramount for adding to the adventure. For example, battling another crew who is guarding a large treasure hoard, or gaining new strength after completing a long and emotional arc full of character development.
It keeps the game feeling fresh and like the players are making actual headway in the world. It is also best to consider what kind of awards are in order, as completing various tasks allows different kinds of awards.
