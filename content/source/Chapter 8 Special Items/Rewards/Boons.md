### Boons

Much like any shonen anime, when a character reaches the end of their arc, they go through a grand transformation. A great way to reward this growth in character is to grant them a boon.
A boon would act much like the Epic Boons of 5e, except with a few guidelines to make them around the same strength.
Each boon may include the following, but ultimately is up to what the DM believes is appropriate:
* A single ability score increase of 2, increasing the maximum of that ability score as well. This ability cannot increase a score beyond 30.
* An additional passive ability. Best suited that it meshes well with the character.
* An additional ability that requires activation, and may have a limited number of uses. Best suited that it meshes well with the character.
For example, let's say you had a Longleg Barbarian that dreams to be the fastest runner. Let's say they defeated someone with a devil fruit that granted them unbelievable speed in a fight, say a Sound Logia. Here is a possible boon to give them:
#### Boon of Super Sonic Speed
* Increase your Dexterity Score by 2, increasing the maximum by 2. This ability cannot increase a score beyond 30.
* The user gains an additional 30ft movement speed.
* When the user uses the Sprint feature of their Long Leg race, they may instead teleport the distance rather than run.
On the next page are a few more example Boons.
#### Boon of Enhanced Size
* Increase your Strength or Constitution Score by 2, increasing the maximum by 2. This ability cannot increase a score beyond 30.

#### Boon of the Tale Weaver
* Increase your Charisma Score by 2, increasing the maximum by 2. This ability cannot increase a score beyond 30.
