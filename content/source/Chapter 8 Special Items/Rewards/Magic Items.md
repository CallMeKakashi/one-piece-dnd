### "Magic" Items

"Magic" items, or mastercraft items in terms of this guide, are special items with abilities outside the norm. They can be inventions, high-ranked swords, special medicine, or even objects with a lot of history.
In the standard 5th edition, there is the attunement system, which limits the number of magic items a person can use at a time. I find it's best to ignore that in this game as it is an unnecessary restriction for the world. Instead, grant magic items that specifically help certain classes. Though again, this is a suggestion.
Some of the best magic items a DM can award are some that are specific to certain players. For example, giving a player who is a Brawler a Dragon Hide Belt, flavored as the belt that belonged to a famous captain of a pirate crew who was also a Brawler. The item directly aids their Brawler class features. A little personalized touch can go a long way, even if the item itself isn't super impactful.
Awards such as these can come from treasure hoards of crews, perhaps in armories inside fortresses of Marines, won in a high-stakes gamble with an elite member of the black market, or even wielded by powerful enemies after defeating them.
Mastercraft items such as these can come in many shapes and sizes, however, a great example of a magic item are Vestiges. In _Critical Role_ there are these special magic items called Vestiges. The actual lore is beside the point, but the main attraction is that they grow stronger at key climactic moments. These items should be rare, and not given willy nilly.
#### Running Staged Magic Items
Staged items come in three stages: Dormant, Wakened, and Exalted. Dormant is how they typically start, at their weakest. Awakened is the step after, achieved when the DM determines it is the right moment, typically after grand character moments. The final step is Exalted when the item is at its strongest. Here is a guide on how to run them.
##### Dormant
* An item such as this is typically a +1 to something, attack and damage rolls, DCs, AC, Saving Throws, or possibly even setting the user's ability scores to a higher number while using it.
* 1 or 2 additional benefits.
##### Wakened
* Item becomes a +2 or increases the user's ability scores even more if that was what the Dormant state had done.
* 1 or 2 more additional benefits, potentially based on short or long rest, lasting 10 minutes, or based on certain class resources.
##### Exalted
* Item becomes a +3 or increases the user's ability scores even more if that was what the Dormant and Awakened state had done.
* 1 or 2 more additional benefits, potentially based on short or long rest, lasting 1 hour, or based on certain class resources.
