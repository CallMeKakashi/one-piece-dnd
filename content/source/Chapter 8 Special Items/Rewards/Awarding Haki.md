### Awarding Haki

Haki is a necessity when a character reaches the end of the Grand Line and begins their transition into the New World. One of the major gripes with some of the haki systems I have seen is that they make haki too strong, and force characters to only have one type of haki for the entire game. Do not do that with this haki system. This system of haki was built to have multiple types, though don't expect to master all of them like Luffy.
Haki is typically awarded after or even during a stressful moment for a character. In addition, the character must also be of 8th level to achieve the strength needed to utilize haki.
When a character does awaken to the power of haki, they typically awaken only one type at first. This first awakening of haki represents the character's affinity. Affinity in a certain type of haki means the user can utilize their full proficiency bonus when using observation or armament haki, or in the case of conqueror's, access the final step towards conqueror's haki.
Lacking affinity to a type of haki doesn't mean a character cannot hope to learn it, but rather they would use half their proficiency bonus, rounded up.
Awarding haki after this initial awakening is much simpler, as it typically coincides with learning an additional haki ability of their choice every 2 levels after level 8. However, if the event the characters level up from was typically stressful, they may learn 2 haki benefits instead of 1.
Conqueror's haki should be a rare commodity amongst players, as well as NPCs outside of particularly powerful individuals. Even more so with affinity in Conqueror's haki. More often than not, the captain of the crew holds such potential.
