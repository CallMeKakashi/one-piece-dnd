### Seastone and Seastone Items

Seastone is a naturally-occurring and immensely rare substance that is as hard as diamond, best known for its negation of Devil Fruit abilities as it simulates the wavelength of the ocean. Seastone is most notably used as cuffs to weaken devil fruit users, but they have also been used as weaponry, and to hide ships from seakings below. Here are some examples:
*** Seastone Weapons*** There are two types of seastone weapons, tipped and full. Tipped seastone weapons are a +2 weapon, and any creature hit by this attack has any of their devil fruit immunities and resistances ignored.
In addition, when the weapon deals damage, the target, if they are a devil fruit user, must make a Constitution Saving Throw, DC 20. On a failed save, they suffer the knee deep weakness as per their Ocean's Scorn feature. On a successful save, they are unaffected. This effect is continuous if the weapon is embedded into them, like a seastone bullet, or if they are being grappled with a seastone weapon.
If armament haki is utilized to reduce the damage from a seastone weapon, or to grant advantage on the Constitution Saving Throw, the target automatically succeeds.
Full seastone weapons are similar, but with a +3 modifier.
*** Seastone Armor*** Seastone armor is +3 armor. In addition, when the wearer is grappling a devil fruit user, the target must make the Constitution Saving Throw both when they get grappled and at the end of each of their turns if they continue to be grappled.
If the wearer is a devil fruit user, they are also subject to the Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns.
*** Seastone Handcuffs*** Seastone handcuffs are manacles, that cannot take damage or be broken unless the creature has the Color of Armament Master haki ability. While a creature is bound by these handcuffs they suffer the waist-deep weakness of Ocean's Scorn, ending when freed. A creature can attempt to make the Constitution Saving Throw at the end of their turns, but only when in combat.
