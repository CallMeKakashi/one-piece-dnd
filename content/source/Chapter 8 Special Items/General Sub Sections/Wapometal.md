### Wapometal

Wapometal is a shape-retaining metal made using the powers of the Munch-Munch fruit. Any object and weapon made using this metal cannot be permanently destroyed unless it is annihilated. At the start of each day, it will repair itself to its former glory, as if nothing had happened to it.
