### Cursed Weapons

All weapons that are expertly crafted house their own "personality" that sets them apart from regular blades.  Most swordsmen that wield these weapons have the impression that they are cursed as they are not skilled enough to fit the strong personality of the weapons. In D&D terms, they essentially provide an initial debuff to its wielder, but if they can overcome it through repeated usage surviving the curse, that debuff will instead become an ability of the sword.
