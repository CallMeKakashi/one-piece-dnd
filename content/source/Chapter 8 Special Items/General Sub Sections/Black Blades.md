### Black Blades

Black Blades are weapons that have been wielded by some of the greatest swordsmen this world has ever seen. Infused with years of potent armament haki, they render the blade ever sharp. While called Black Blades, they can theoretically be any melee weapon or even a single piece of ammo, but that is super rare. Black Blades are virtually indestructible as the will from their wielder sustains them indefinitely. Also, Black Blades deal an extra +2 damage by default. While made with haki, they are not haki-imbued so they do not bypass resistances and immunities.
