### Ranked Weapons

Ranked Weapons are among some of the rarest and most powerful blades ever forged. They are separated into 4 distinct ranks: Grade, Skillful Grade, Great Grade, and Supreme Grade. However, most ranked blades are widely known, other weapons that are unranked can have these same bonuses.
- Grade swords have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- Skillful Grade swords have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. All rankings equal to and above this may have extra benefits (or curses).
- Great Grade swords have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- Supreme Grade swords have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, but all have an additional ability, most black blades fall under this category.
