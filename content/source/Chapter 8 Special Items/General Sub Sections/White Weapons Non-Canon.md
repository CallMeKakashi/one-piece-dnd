### White Weapons (Non-Canon)

While Black Blades are weapons infused with armament haki, White Weapons utilize the investment of high-level observation haki. White Weapons can be any weapon and they typically glow a faint or even notable white. Due to the lingering observation of haki in it, the weapon seems to naturally follow the will of its wielder, striking at the best angles possible. White Weapons permanently have a +2 bonus to attack rolls.
An important thing to note, while it is theoretically possible for a weapon to be both a Black Blade and a White Weapon, such weapons would be extremely rare and sought out by higher powers like the World Government and the Four Emperors.
