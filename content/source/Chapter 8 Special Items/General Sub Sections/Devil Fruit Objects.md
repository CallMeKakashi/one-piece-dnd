### Devil Fruit Objects

By some unknown miracle of science, someone figured out the ability to feed objects zoan-type devil fruits. While theoretically paramecia and logia types are possible, they may not work as the object doesn't have a will to activate the ability, as opposed to zoans which seem to grant life when fed to objects.
Any object with a zoan-type devil fruit now counts as a beast, no matter what form they take. They gain the ability scores of the animal, but these might be increased depending on what the object was. Glass might have a weaker constitution, while a solid sword would have a higher constitution.
The creation gains intelligence and autonomy, however, due to being an object, its will isn't too strong, and it can be easily commanded. These objects can use their bonus action to transform and do all their devil fruit stuff. Due to being objects, they do not need to breathe, but still get weakened by seastone and water.
