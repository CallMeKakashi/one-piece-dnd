### Vivre Card

Vivre Cards is a piece of paper made from a clipping of a person's fingernail. It is completely waterproof and fireproof but can be torn. The pieces can then be given to a cared person so that one would be separated.
The torn pieces will point to and move towards each other no matter where they are in the world, allowing one to always be able to tell which direction the other person is in. However, it doesn’t tell you the distance or about any obstacles that might be in the way.
True to the name "paper of life", the life force of the owner, the person whose fingernail the Vivre Card was made from, is reflected on the paper. If the life force of the owner is weakening, the card will begin to burn away. It will vanish if they die.
