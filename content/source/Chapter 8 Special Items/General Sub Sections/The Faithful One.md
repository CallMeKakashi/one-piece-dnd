### The Faithful One

A Great Grade dagger with a blue hilt and a repeating pattern of wings and feathers. This blade is a +3 dagger but is also cursed. Any time the blade is used to attack, roll 1d20. If it is a 1, the blade vanishes and hides within a 120ft radius of the wielder. Once the curse is overcome, the blade always returns to the wielder's hand as a free action.
