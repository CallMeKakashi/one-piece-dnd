### Smiles

Smiles are a type of Artificial Devil Fruits that when eaten have a 10% chance of granting the user a slight zoan transformation that is permanent.
When the smile is eaten, the consumer rolls 1d10. If it is a 10, they get the Ocean's Scorn feature from Devil Fruits and gain the abilities listed below. Any other number, they get Ocean's Scorn and are permanently smiling.
The ability they receive is that of a random animal, and the placement is also random. However, they will follow these rulings:
- ***Natural Weapon.*** The user gains a permanent natural weapon based on the animal it represents. For example, the talon of an Eagle deals 1d6 slashing damage. This weapon is a +2. Through training, it can be transformed back to normal as a bonus action.
- ***Enhanced Speed.*** The user's speed is enhanced, equal, or even greater than the animal it represents. For example, the wings of an owl, allow the user to fly 30ft.
- ***Extra Head.*** Some Smiles manifest the actual head of a sapient animal. This animal has its own action but generally will follow the rule of the creature attached to it.
- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Increases an ability score by 2.
