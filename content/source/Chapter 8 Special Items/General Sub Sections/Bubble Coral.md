### Bubble Coral

Bubble Corals allow the user to accomplish many things, but most importantly the ability to push water and produce air for humans to breathe in places like Fishman island.
As an action, the user can create a 30ft radius sphere of air within a water-logged area, pushing all water out while not affecting any other creature. The bubble can be popped if it takes over 30 damage.
