### Defiance Of The Red World

As an award for defeating Warlord of the Sea, Red World, he uses his devil fruit, the Smith-Smith fruit to transform his dying body into a sniper rifle. It has the following properties:
##### Dormant
* Defiance is a Rifle. It deals 2d8 piercing + 1d6 necrotic damage.
* The weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
* It ignores the reload property as it produces its own bullets made out of bone.
##### Wakened
* It deals 2d10 piercing + 1d8 necrotic damage
* The weapon has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
* As a bonus action, the wielder can mark a creature they can see for 1 hour with concentration. While a creature is marked, it has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws of a chosen ability score by the wielder. The mark can be transfered as a bonus action to another creature. This ability can be used a number of times equal to the wielder's proficiency bonus, regaining all uses back on a long rest.
##### Exalted
* It deals 2d12 piercing + 1d10 necrotic damage.
* The weapon has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
* Due to the biological nature of the weapon, the wielder and the weapon have grown into one. Defiance cannot be disarmed from the wielder, and can be extended or retracted from the user's body.
* When the necrotic damage of the weapon is dealt to a creature, the wielder regains a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage.
