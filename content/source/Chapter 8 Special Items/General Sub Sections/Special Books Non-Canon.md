### Special Books (Non-Canon)

Special books are an object created using the awakened powers of the Book-Book fruit, holding the knowledge of others within books that can be absorbed once read. Can store proficiency and expertise in skills, weapons, armor, tools, languages, feats, and any additional abilities listed in the previous chapter. Once a book is read by one creature, it loses the ability to grant more knowledge and turns to dust.
