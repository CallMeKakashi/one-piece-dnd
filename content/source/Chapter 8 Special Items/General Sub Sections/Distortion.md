### Distortion

A Skillful Grade rapier with a purple guard and a dark gray blade point. This blade is a +2 Rapier and cursed. This weapon's curse is that the wielder's vision is distorted when holding this weapon. All attacks against the wielder are made at advantage. After overcoming the curse, the wielder can blur the vision of their enemy. Once per turn, when the wielder hits a creature, that creature must make a Wisdom Saving Throw, DC (8 + Proficiency Bonus + Wisdom Modifier). On a failure, that creature has disadvantage on attacks against the wielder. On a success, they are not affected that turn.
