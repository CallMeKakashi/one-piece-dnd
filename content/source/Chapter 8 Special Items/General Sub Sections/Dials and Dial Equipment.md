### Dials and Dial Equipment

Dials are a very useful tool, allowing you to use certain creations and tricks. Most of the dials that deal damage are rather rare, so those Photo Dials and Light dials are likely the most common, but they do show up now and then.
##### Axe Dial
Axe Dials are standard dial that launches an X-shaped blade of wind when it is activated. It counts as a one-handed, simple ranged weapon (30/120ft). It deals 2d6 + Dexterity slashing damage.
##### Ball Dials
Ball Dials are a special type of dial that produce ball clouds. The ball clouds are sturdy and can be walked on, each being a sphere with a radius of 5ft. Each cloud lasts 1 hour in the sky island's atmosphere, however with enough time, research, and resources, they can last just as long in the blue sea. The ball clouds are hollow and can be used to store stuff like traps.
##### Breath Dials
Breath Dials are a common type of dial that can be used to store gases and even wind. This allows the user to cast the Wind Blast trick, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. Breath dials can even be used to house explosive and poisonous gasses. Dials like these can be used to propel ships and sky vehicles, but big vehicles that require a lot of dials.
##### Flame Dials
Flame Dials are a special type of dial that unleashes fire. This allows the wielder to cast the Fire Bolt trick, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.
##### Flash Dials
Flash Dials are one of the three types of dials that unleash and stores light, this one, in particular, releasing it as a flash. This allows the wielder to cast the Blindness/Deafness Creation (Blindness only), using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. Flash dials have 3 charges, regaining them at the end of a long rest.
##### Flavor Dials
Flavor dials are a common dial that allows you to flavor food, store smells, and store gasses much like breath dials. This allows the user to cast the Prestidigitation trick, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.
##### Heat Dials
Heat Dials are a special type of dial that produces pure heat energy, not fire. If attached to a weapon, it can cause that weapon to deal fire damage instead of its normal damage and makes it a +1 mastercraft weapon. This doesn't stack with already +1 weapons.
##### Impact Dials
Impact Dials are some of the rarest and most dangerous dials to use in combat, at least if you are someone who can't take the recoil.
As a reaction to being hit by a weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, the user can absorb the impact of that attack, making it so they don’t take any damage. This dial can only store 1 attack at a time.
After absorbing a single attack, the user, as an action, can release that impact by making one unarmed strike roll against a target. If the attack hits, the target takes the damage that was absorbed in the form of force damage. However, half of the damage being sent out is also dealt to the user.
For example, they absorb an attack that deals 100 damage. If they choose to release that damage, their enemy will take that 100 damage, but also the user will take 50 force damage.
An impact Dial can only take 3 hits before it loses all of its uses. These uses can be repaired with a dial kit check, DC 16, during a long rest. If you expend the last use, roll a d20. On a 1, the it is destroyed.
##### Reject Dials
Reject Dials are one of the rarest dials to exist, and one of the most dangerous to exist as well. The same rules of Impact Dials apply to Reject Dials, except that the damage released is doubled (if it were accurate it would be x10, but then it would kill everything in one shot), as well as the user gaining 2 levels of exhaustion after every use.
For example, the user absorbs an attack that deals 100 damage. If they release it, it deals 200 damage, and the wielder takes 50 damage while also gaining 2 levels of exhaustion.
A reject dial can only take 3 hits before it loses all of its uses. These uses can be repaired with a dial kit check, DC 22, during a long rest. If you expend the last use, roll a d20. On a 1, the it is destroyed.
##### Jet Dials
Jet Dials are another rare breed of dials, as they are nearly extinct. Essentially they are Breath Dials but deliver a much more powerful blast of gasses. This allows the wielder to cast the Gust of Wind Creation, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. Jet dials have 3 charges, regaining them at the end of a long rest. Jet dials can also be placed on weapons, or be used as part of making unarmed strikes. This makes them a +1 weapon and raises the damage dice size by 1.
##### Lamp Dials
Lamp Dials steadily produce light like a lamp. It allows the user to use the Light trick.
##### Milky Dials
Milky Dials are dials that can create sea clouds. As an action, a user can create a 10ft x 10ft x 10ft area of sea clouds that can be used to skate on using dial vehicles.
##### Eisen Dials
Eisen Dials are a rare breed of dials that produces iron clouds, clouds that are hard as iron, however, it is currently limited to forming walls without a means to control the shape. The wielder can cast the Wall of Stone creation, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. It has 3 uses and regains them after a long rest.
##### Tone Dials
Tone Dials are dials that can record and store sound. They can be activated or stopped as a free action, but most can only hold at an hour of sound.
##### Vision Dials
Vision Dials can store light, they are the sky island equivalent of cameras. They can record up to 300 images. They can be modified to record video, and be paired with a tone Dial to record audio. Activating them is a free action.

Water Dials are a breed of dials that stores water. The wielder can cast the Create/Destroy Water creation, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. It has 3 uses and regains them after a long rest.
##### Thunder Dials
Thunder dials are a rare breed of dials that allow the wielder to produce and store electricity. The wielder can cast the Shocking Grasp trick, using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.
##### Burn Bazooka
Burn Bazookas are a special weapon created in the sky islands utilizing flame dials to essentially create a flamethrower, but it can also double as a portable swivel gun.
The Burn Bazooka can either be used as a portable swivel gun, or the wielder can use thier action to use the Elemental Blast creation (fire only), using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. It has 3 uses and regains them after a long rest.
##### Burn Blade
Burn Blades are special weapons also made using flame and breath dials in the sky to create a blade of fire that can cut through most things.
The wielder can use it to cast the Ardent Blade creation (using fire damage), using their Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. It has 3 uses and regains them after a long rest.
##### Eisen Whip
The Eisen Whip is a rare and powerful weapon, enabling the user a wide variety of weapons at their disposal, as well as a lot of defensive capabilities by being able to form walls on the fly. It can also be used as rope and or barbed wire to bind people.
As a bonus action, the user can change the shape of their weapon to any pre-existing melee weapon (or just any shape in general). It is a +1 weapon. The range of attacks with the Eisen whip, despite being a melee weapon is 60ft, and it can travel around corners.

##### Flash Gun
Flash Guns are powerful weapon that allows the user to flash a bright light from a flash dial while also firing a gun at an enemy, making it difficult to dodge.
Once per turn, this +1 gun fires its first bullet with advantage against an enemy that sees the flash. If the enemy has any way to see without eyes, they are unaffected.
##### Heat Javelin

##### Milky Arrows
Milky Arrows are arrows that have milky dials embedded in them. When they are fired, they create a 5ft wide path of sea clouds equal to the range that weapon was fired from. These sea clouds can be sailed on. They last 1 hour but fade early when not under the effects of the sky islands' high atmosphere.
