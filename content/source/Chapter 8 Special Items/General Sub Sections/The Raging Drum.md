### The Raging Drum

A small, portable drum bound with some kind of red hide. Wielded by some of the most talented bards, and has seen some of the most devasting wars, the Raging Drum is a must have for those who bang the drums of war.
This drum counts as a Bard Apparatus that grants the user a +2 bonus to their creative attack rolls and DCs for their Bard Creations.
Additionally, whenever you roll initiative, and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration remaining, you regain 1 usage.
This drum has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
***Commanding Beat.*** While holding the drum, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the Command creation using your Creativity DC if you are a Bard.
***Broken Battle Bridge.*** While holding the drum, you can use an action to expend 3 charges, to play a song of pure authority and fear, you use the Fear creation using your Creativity DC if you are a Bard.
# Reflavored Items
Due to the setting of the _One Piece_ World, magic doesn't exist, but rather takes the form of devices, expertly forged weapons and armor, and much, much more. This results in certain items needing to be either flavored or even reworded to better aid a new DM in navigating this system and setting. Every magic item is not listed, but a majority can be flavored to fit into the One Piece world. All the ones shown here are mainly examples.
