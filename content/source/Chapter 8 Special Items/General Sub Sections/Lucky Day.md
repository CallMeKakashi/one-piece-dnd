### Lucky Day

A Great Grade Longsword. It has a Gaelic design and a clover-shaped pommel. It is a +3 Longsword. This sword was fed the Human-Human fruit Model Leprechaun, allowing the sword to transform into a Leprechaun and a Leprechaun-Sword hybrid. The sword is sentient and counts as a Small Humanoid. It is proficient in stealth, and its unarmed strikes are equal to its blade's damage. As a bonus action, the sword can be used to create lucky clovers that can be used to reroll attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws, much like the lucky feat. Limited to how much Devil Fruit Uses Lucky Day has left.
