### The Silver Seer

Forged during the Void Century, the Silver Seer is a shield that has seen many battles, wielded by countless warriors and sentinels. This large shield, when found, is rusty but clearly made from silver. Multiple ridges within its surface lead to the center with a circular divot.
When any creature that has a charisma score of less than 18 attempts to don the shield, it immediately doffs itself and the creature must make a Charisma Saving Throw, DC 18. On a failure, they take 3d10 psychic damage and become blinded for 1 minute, repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the creature takes half damage.
When a creature with 18 charisma dons it, the cursed shield springs to life, a glowing eye only visible to the wielder appears in the divot, the shield laugh's quietly saying, "You seem real interesting." Only the wielder can hear the shield.
The Silver Seer is sentient, with an intelligence of 16, wisdom of 18, and charisma of 22. It has expertise in all wisdom and charisma skill checks. It is Chaotic Good in that it wants its wielder to become the best warrior, forcing its curse on them inorder to overcome it stronger. The shield can not be removed from the creature unless the Remove curse creation is used against the shield, but can be moved around the body without resistance.
Overcoming the curse of the shield comes in multiple stages.
##### Stirring
While the Shield is stirring, it is a +1 shield, however the wielder, when they roll initiative or Perception (Wisdom) Checks, must make a Charisma Saving Throw, DC 18. On a failure, they have disadvantage on all initiative and Perception checks for the next hour. On a success, the creature instead has advantage for 1 hour.
Additionally, the wielder learns the Protection Fighting Style.
##### Wakened
While the Shield is Wakened, it becomes stronger. The wielder now by default has advantage on initiative rolls and Perception (Wisdom) Checks while wielding the shield. The shield becomes a +2.
At the start of each dawn, the shield will pick a random ability score. Every time the wielder makes a saving throw using that ability score, they must make another Charisma Saving Throw, DC 18. On a failure, they automatically that saving throw. On a success, the creature instead takes half damage on a failure, and no damage on a success on the saving throw.
Additionally, when you use the Protection Fighting Style, the creature you are protecting (if they aren’t yourself) can add the shield’s AC to its AC
##### Ascendant
When the Shield is Ascendant, it has all the previous benefits, except for the following. It becomes a +3,
At the start of each dawn the wielder gets to choose the ability score for the saving throw and doesn't have to make the Charisma Saving throw when they make the Saving throw, taking half damage on a failure, and no damage on a success.
Additionally, the Saving Throw effect to take half or no damage applies to allies within a 10ft radius of yourself.
