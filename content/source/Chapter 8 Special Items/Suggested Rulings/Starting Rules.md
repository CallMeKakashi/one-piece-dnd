### Starting Rules

It is recommended that when starting a game, the players should start at 3rd level. Starting at 3rd level will enable the group to have a stronger start, much like the characters in _One Piece_ that can take on multiple foes during their introduction. Level 1 characters have very low hit points and it is very easy to accidentally kill them, and typically they level up to 2nd and 3rd level rather quickly, so might as well just skip that unnecessary period of weakness.
Also, having them start with their subclass features will able that to factor better within their backstories. For example, if they were a Brawler trained in the ways of the Six Powers, it would not make sense for them to not have access to any of them until they reach 3rd level.
In addition to starting at 3rd level, the players should also have a free starting feat to enable more customization and diversity between characters. This is in addition to any feats granted from their Roles and Backgrounds.
Remember, this is a suggestion made from the experience and testimony from multiple people playing _One Piece_ 5e. If you as the DM truly wish to start them off at level 1, you are completely in your right to do so.
