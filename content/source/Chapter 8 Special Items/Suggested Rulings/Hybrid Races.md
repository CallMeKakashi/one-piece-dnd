### Hybrid Races

The _One Piece_ world is vast, filled with various types of people from all around the Four Blues and the Grand Line. It comes as no surprise that players may want to be of mixed lineage, such as being a fishman-human hybrid.
A simple way to rule this, instead of having to make a hybrid race for each seperate combination, the player can mechanically be one of the races, but appear as a hybrid. For example, say you want to be a human-mink hybrid. Your race would mechanically be that of a mink, you just would also appear more human. There is no need to change up the mechanics of the mink's electro to be weaker just because you aren't full blooded.
A more complex way would be to combine some racial traits, but not all for balancing. Take for example, a Longlimb Human, a hybrid between a Long Arm and a Long Leg. You would gain the Human traits in addition to the Long Limbs and Tall Stride features of the two subraces, but none of the other features like Sudden Reach or Sprint.
