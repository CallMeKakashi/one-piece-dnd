### Story-Classing

Story-Classing is a system where players, through interacting with the world, can gain new abilities that are separate from their classes, races, etc. These abilities can resemble features from other classes, but don't necessarily have to be. Similar to how Additional Powers can be learned.
##### Joyful's _One Piece_ DMing Experience
"In my game, the optional rule of multiclassing has been banned. While it is best employed as a story element such as Vax'ildan in _Critical Role_, in every other instance I have seen firsthand, it was mostly an avenue for min-maxers who are too focused on making their character the strongest mechanically, rather than trying to have an actual character. This is where I propose Story-Classing as an alternative for multiclassing.
For example, the Captain of my game is a Brute Fighter who uses the Unarmed Fighting Style. Through his travels, he has learned martial arts such as the Eight Impacts Fist, Iron Body, and Tempest Kick. Currently, he is learning Fishman Karate by being trained by an allied crew of Fishmen. These techniques he has learned throughout his journey, from the start of the North Blue, all the way as they near the end of the Grand Line. In this way, he retains his abilities as a fighter but also learns martial arts without having to multiclass into a Brawler.
This goes for the rest of my players as well, we have an Okama Kenpo Brawler who has learned the Finger Pistol and Paper Art techniques, A Gunslinger Fighter who has Moon Walk, Shave, and a Cunning Action. A Savant who has learned the Destructive Wave Additional Power, allowing them to launch area-of-effect slashes with their sword, as well as Foxfire Style.
As time goes on in their journey, they gain more allies who teach them new techniques. The same can be said for their NPCs. The Captain taught their musician NPC with a sword on how to use Second Wind and gain a Fighting Style. This growth makes the game world feel more alive, and enables for more fun interactions between players and NPCs, without multiclassing."
