### Proficiency Reclaim

Certain features grant the user proficiency in a skill, set of tools, saving throw, etc. Some of those features may unintentionally overlap with existing proficiencies, leading to some features being wasted. In order to prevent that, follow this rule:
In the event an ability gives you proficiency in a skill check, saving throw, and tool check, and you are already proficient in that ability, you may instead choose proficiency in another of the same type.
