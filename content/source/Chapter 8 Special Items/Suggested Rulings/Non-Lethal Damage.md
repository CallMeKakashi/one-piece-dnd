### Non-Lethal Damage

It is no fun when you trap players into an archetype they never asked for. Every ranged character or spellcaster knows all too well the inability to deal non-lethal damage, marking them as people with no mercy, though that could be further from the truth.
Tonally, it also doesn't fit with the anime. Imagine if Ussop killed someone every time he fired his slingshot. All damage from any source can be lethal or non-lethal, the choice is up to the creature dealing the damage, meaning they don't instantly kill a creature when their hit points reach 0.
