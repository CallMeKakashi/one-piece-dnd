### Lingering Injuries

Is combat feeling a bit stale after one too many simple encounters? Luckily there is a solution, introducing lingering injuries. One of the most common ways DMs can spice up their combats is providing an extra layer of danger and variety, by making damage have a bit more of an impact, with injuries that shape the characters and their interactions going forwards.
272 This rule is heavily inspired by the Lingering Injuries table present on page 272 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, though with some key modifications to better fit the system.
When a creature is hit with a critical hit, or takes damage greater than or equal to half its hit point maximum, the DM rolls a d20. If the result is a 1, the creature gains a severe lingering injury. If the result is 2-10, the creature gains a moderate lingering injury. If the result is 11-20, the creature doesn't suffer a lingering injury. A creature choosing to deal non-lethal damage can choose not to inflict an injury.
If a creature sustains a lingering injury, the DM can roll on either the Moderate or Severe Lingering Injuries table on the next page to determine the nature of the injury. Or the DM could choose which one would be most appropriate.
In the case of a critical hit, if a creature manages to reduce the damage to 0 (via haki, immunity, etc.), then they don't have to roll a lingering injury.
Lingering injuries are separated into two types: Moderate and Severe. Moderate injuries are typically injuries that are not as dangerous, but still impactful, such as a nasty scar or broken ribs. Severe injuries are injuries whose effects range from devastating to deadly. The Moderate and Severe Lingering Injuries tables on the next page displays the results.
#### Moderate Lingering Injuries
| d20 | Moderate Injury |
|:---:|:------------|
|  1-2  | **Break a Finger.** Same as losing a finger, except your finger heals when you receive healing. |
|  3-4  | **Minor Scar.** The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Healing from creations of 6th level or higher, such as from the Heal and Regenerate creation, removes the scar. |
|  5  | **Internal Injury.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting. |
|  6-7  | **Broken Ribs.** This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10. |
|  8  | **Festering Wound.** Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if the Lesser Restoration creation is used on you. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. A critical success counts as 2 successes. |
|  9-10  | **Horrible Scar.** You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have a -1 on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and a +1 on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar. |
| d20 | Moderate Injury |
|:---:|:------------|
|  11-12  | **Limp.** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Healing removes the limp. |
|  13-14  | **Broken Arm or Hand.** Same as Lose an Arm or Hand, except the arm is healed after receiving healing. |
|  15-16  | **Broken Foot or Leg.** Same as Lose a Foot or Leg, except the leg is healed after receiving healing. |
| 17 | **Concussion.** You have disadvantage on Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom ability checks and saving throws for 7 days, or until the Lesser Restoration creation is used on you. |
| 18 | **Black Eye.** Same as losing an eye, except it is healed after receiving healing.  If you have two black eyes after sustaining this injury, you are blinded while you have both black eyes. |
| 19 | **Trachea Trauma.** You are unable to speak until you receive healing. |
| 20 | **Ringing Ear.** Same as Lost an Ear, except it is healed after receiving healing. If you have both ears ringing after sustaining this injury, you become deafened while both ears are ringing. |
#### Severe Lingering Injuries
| d20 | Severe Injury |
|:---:|:------------|
|  1-2  | **Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Creations such as the Regenerate creation can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded. |
|  3-5  | **Lose an Arm or a Hand.** You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Creations such as the Regenerate creation can restore the lost appendage. |
|  6-8  | **Lose a Foot or Leg.** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Creations such as the Regenerate creation can restore the lost appendage. |
|  9-11  | **Lost an Ear.** You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound. If you have no ears remaining after sustaining this injury, you are deafened. |
|  12-14  | **Punctured Lung.** You can take either an action or a bonus action or your turn, but not both. The injury heals if you receive healing. If you puncture both lungs your hit points drop to 0 and you immediately begin dying.
|
|  15-17  | **Lose a Finger.** You have a -1 to all Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Dexterity checks to use fine tools (such as thieves' tools) using the hand with which you lost the finger, for each finger that hand is missing. Creations such as the Regenerate creation can restore the lost finger. If you lose all the fingers from one hand, then it functions as if you had lost a hand.
|
|  18-20  | **Skull Fracture.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive healing or if you spend thirty days doing nothing but resting. |
In the case of severe lingering injuries, some of the options involve dismemberment. For dismemberment, if a body part is still present, a creature that is proficient in Medicine can make a Medicine Check, DC 15, to reattach it. On a success, the body part is reattached. On a failure, The patient takes 1d8 necrotic damage and the body part is not reattached. Each failure increases the DC by 5. If the DC increases past 30, the body part is lost.
While this rule may not be for everyone, it is important to consider the variety and tension it may bring to a battle. Imagine a final confrontation against a powerful enemy, and one of your attacks slices off their arm near the end of the battle. There is also the fact it incentivizes healing a creature outside of just simply brining them back from 0 hit points. The rule is also set to not happen too often, only happening when faced with ridiculous levels of damage, or a critical hit.
