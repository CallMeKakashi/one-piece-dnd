### Critical Saving Throws

In standard 5th edition, a critical success or failure has no impact on saving throws. This rule aims to rectify that.
When a creature critically succeeds a saving throw of any kind, they automatically succeed the saving throw, and they are unaffected by it completely, be it damage, or any other effect.
When a creature critically fails a saving throw, they automatically fail the saving throw, and if it deals damage, it deals an additional damage die.
