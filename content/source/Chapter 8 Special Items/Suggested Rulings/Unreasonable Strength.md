### Unreasonable Strength

In the _One Piece_ world, characters have displayed unreasonable feats of strength, such as lifting up buildings, carrying backpacks several times their mass, wielding weapons that are described as multiple tons, and carrying in general heavy masses. For DM's who want to emulate that very style, this ruling is just for you:
Follow the normal caluclations for the weight you can carry, push, drag, lift, etc. and multiply the result by your level.
**Carrying Capacity**
For example, say you are a 5th level Fighter, medium sized, with a Strength Score of 18, and have no features that increase your carrying capacity. The weight you can carry is 18 (Your Strength Score) x 15 (Standard Multiplier) x 5 (Level) = 1350 lbs.
**Push, Lift, and Drag**
Taking the same example as the previously mentioned Level 5 Fighter, the amount of weight they can lift, drag, push, etc. is multiplied by 2. So 2700 lbs using the same example.
**Other Modifiers**
Racial, class, size, and other features that augment your carrying capacity and pusjing, lifting, and drag weight still apply their benefits as normal.
For example, if the previously mentioned Fighter had the Powerful Build featutre, increasing the weight they can lift, carry, push, drag from medium to large, then the carrying capacity is further multiplied, equaling 2700.
