### Party Diversity

Diversity is the spice of life. A party should not have too many of the same characters, most notably the doubling up of rare races such as minks and such as most games would start in one of the four blues.
For example, multiple characters playing minks starting in one of the Blues, having multiple Barbarians, or having multiple Savants. The best part is a diverse party as each member has something new to bring to the table.
The only exception to class doubling is Fighters as most of their abilities are dependent on their subclass and fighting styles, which can vary greatly. Also mechanically, it is not a great idea when most of the players fill the exact same archetype. Imagine if all of the crew happened to choose unarmed, melee characters by chance with no creative casters, it would not be pretty.
