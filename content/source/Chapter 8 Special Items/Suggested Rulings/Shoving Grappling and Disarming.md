### Shoving, Grappling, and Disarming

Shoving and grappling are some parts of the game that are often underutilized, and that is likely due to them being localized entirely within the attack action, which mostly benefits only fighters. Here are some new rules for Shoving and Grappling to allow them to be utilized more.
If you can make an attack (or multiple attacks) as either an action or a bonus action, that attack can also be replaced with a grapple or shove attempt. This rule change allows unarmed abilities to be better utilized, such as by Brawlers, Pugilist Barbarians, or anyone with the Unarmed Fighting Style.
In addition you do not need a free hand to initiate a grapple, instead you must use a melee weapon or unarmed strike to satisfy the conditions of a grapple. Also when you shove a creature, you can choose to either shove them backwards, or to the left or right.
There is an optional rule in 5e where a creature can attempt to make a disarming attack that results in no damage on a hit, but disarms a foe. Here is one way you could run it.
In the place of making a melee attack roll, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested against the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins, the defender drops one item they are holding to their feet. Much like shoving or grappling, you cannot attempt this if a creature is two or more size categories larger than you, though abilities that increase your size for the purposes of carrying capacity, grappling, and shoving, also work for this ability.
