### Ursa Array (Variant Standard Array)

This is a suggested rule that was made to help make parties more balanced within each other, at least ability score wise. The rule is based on the concept of standard array, but with some much needed revisions.
When creating a character, you have 6 numbers: 16, 16, 14, 12, 12, 8. Assign each number to a particular ability score from Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
This system maximizes both overall the high power feel we are going for, and a gives fair stat total that leaves the player with few bad stats. This way players, do not have to stress out about rolling bad stats, nor are they locked out of having weaknesses. Keep in mind that this array doesn't account for any other ability score increases gained in creation, such as from race and starting feats.
