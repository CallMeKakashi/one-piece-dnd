### Making Custom Backgrounds

For some players, they might want a more personalized place in the world, such as being a member of a unique faction, or some other niche cases. This rule also exists for DMs who are willing to create a background specific for their own games. Remember, you cannot take a customized background without permission from your DM.
Making a custom background is fairly straightforward, barring coming up with the name, history, or theme of the background.
First, start with the background's skill proficiencies. Each background usually gets 2 skills of their choice from a given list of 4 thematically appropriate skills.
The next step would be to give them a specific tool proficiency. It can be one set of tools, or a choice of 1 from 2 different tool sets. This can also be replaced with a single or various weapon proficiencies.
Furthermore is starting equipment. Starting equipment varies between each background, but most usually start with about 100,000 berries, the tools in which they are proficient in, rations, 1-5 Medkits (small health potions), and any other thematically appropriate items.
Second to last is the background feature. Most background features are similar in strength to feats, either by granting the player with a specific feat from the feats section, a choice between 2 feats, or a feat like ability (such as Fisherman's ability to feed an entire boat).
Last are the suggested characteristics. These aren't super important as characteristcs are entirely optional, but they can still be useful in helping flesh out a character. There are 4 types of suggested characteristics: Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws.
Personality Traits are features of the character, mainly how they see themselves and how they interact with the world on a surface level. Ideals are the character's core beliefs, what they believe they should strive towards. Bonds are the social connections the character has with the world. Flaws are the character's shortcomings as a person.
Each background gives 8 potential Personality Traits, 6 potential Ideals (typically based off alignment), 6 bonds, and 6 flaws. Each of which should be thematic to the background.
