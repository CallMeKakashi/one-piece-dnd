### Improved Help Action

One of the major actions that a creature can take both in and out of combat is the Help action. The Help action allows any allied creature to assist their friends with skill checks or the next attack roll while within 5ft of the target, granting the roll advantage.
A lot of DMs rule the Help action differently, some of us have even experienced this in professional D&D games such as Adventurer's League, adding two new clauses.
The first is that the DM can rule that a creature cannot give the Help action if they in no way that makes sense can help. For example, rules as written, the Barbarian with 8 intelligence that knows nothing about the history of an ancient civilization can still give advantage to a creature making an Intelligence (History) check. A good rule of thumb is that a creature with proficiency in the relevant skill can give the Help action (unless it is for simple actions such as helping lift a heavy object). Another example would be the lack of range, such as helping a creature with a Strength (Athletics) check from 60ft away. Reasonably, that creature couldn't as they would be too far away. So the help action is localized to touch range, unless ruled otherwise.
The second is that when a creature takes the Help action to aid a creature in making an attack, the creature gives advantage on all of that creature's attack rolls on their turn.
