### Collision Damage

Combat doesn’t have to be locked to simple exchanges of attacks that happen on even leveled ground.
**Collision Course.** A majority of abilities in regular 5th edition that involve pushing a creature prevent the user from pushing a creature into another solid surface to damage them. Instead of not being able to, make it so that all abilities that can push a creature act as though the creature is falling, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10ft they are pushed into a solid surface. This will enable more interesting combat when it comes to both players and NPCs. Whether or not the solid surface they are pushed into breaks or not is to the DM's discretion.
