### Creations and Objects

Rules as written in standard 5th edition, most spells cannot deal any damage objects at all, except for a select few, almost all of them can only target creatures. Now this makes sense for spells like Confusion, since you cannot confuse a rock. However this doesn't make sense for AOE damaging spells like Fireball, as the only damage it can inflict is setting something flammable on fire. That is why I propose the following rule:
Structures and objects not being worn or carried can be counted as targets for all damaging creations and tricks. Standard object rules still apply, such as objects being immune to poison and psychic damage.
