### Allied Space Occupancy

Rules as written, it is impossible to willingly occupy the same space as a creature, be they friend or foe. This hard cut rule makes for some unnecessary limits. Technically you cannot stand 1 foot away from somebody, because of this rule. To rectify this, here is an alternative rule.
You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you.
Wheter if a creature is friendly or hostile, moving through their space counts as difficult terrain. You can end your movement in the same square as a friendly creature, but not a hostile one. Be aware that occupying the same space could be dangerous when it comes to certain area of effects.
