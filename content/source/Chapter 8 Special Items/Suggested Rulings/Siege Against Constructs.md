### Siege Against Constructs

Mechanically, in regular 5e, the Siege property doesn't do anything against creatures classified as Constructs. There is good reason for that, since dealing double damage to constructs would make them nearly irrelevant in combat against any martial, unless they had abysmal amounts of hit points. Though it also doesn't make sense that a character with the ability to destroy buildings cannot destroy a robot.
So, as a middle ground, when a Construct is damaged via the Siege property, they take an additional 1d8 damage of the damage type.
