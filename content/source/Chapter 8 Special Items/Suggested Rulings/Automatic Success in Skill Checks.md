### Automatic Success in Skill Checks

There are points in life when you have done something enough times that you can just do them without difficulty. This mainly applies later in the game, and for trivial skill checks.
When a player, say the Navigator of a level 10 party wants to take a look, there doesn't have to be a skill check as it is not a difficult thing for them to do. If anything, their passive perception should suffice at this level to see something as simple as the newspaper has arrived. Or if a character has important knowledge connected to their backstory, they don't need to make a history check to know about it.
Again, these are for more trivial skill checks at higher levels. It speeds things up and keeps the story consistent.
