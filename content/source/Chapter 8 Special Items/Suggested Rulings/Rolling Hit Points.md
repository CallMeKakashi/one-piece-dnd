### Rolling Hit Points

Hit Dice are some of the most stressful parts of D&D as there is no way to change a bad roll. For example, a melee fighter who repeatedly has bad luck in hit points can roll so bad that they somehow have fewer hits points than the gadgeteer who has a lower constitution modifier than them. In general hit dice more often than not pull downwards, generating unwarranted stress.
So there are two ways to rectify this, either always granting the average Hit Points per level, or having them roll, but if they roll below the average of their hit dice, they may instead take the average. This way, there is still luck involved, but not to the point where your front liners start having significantly fewer hit points than your supports for no reason.
