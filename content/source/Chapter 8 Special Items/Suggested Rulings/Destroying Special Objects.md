### Destroying Special Objects

Destroying an object such as a window or a standard longsword is a relatively simple task. However destroying high grade materials such as ranked weapons and sea stone require much more herculean power.
Objects of high grade, such as any mastercraft +1-3 weapons, seastone, diamonds, etc. are immune to all damage unless that damage comes from a source of equal or greater quality, if an ability specifically states it can, or if the cause is from a creature with Armament Haki Master.
For example, in order to destroy a +2 weapon, you would either need to use another +2 weapon, a +3 weapon, have the Armament Haki Master feature, or have a devil fruit that specifies you can such as the Rust-Rust fruit's ability to corrode any metal.
