## Creation Lists

This Appendix describes the most common creations found in the world of _One Piece_. Creations function similarly to spells if 5th edition. However, due to rebalancing, every creation has been altered slightly. The descriptions for each creation are shown in the next section.
Additionally, creation is a more obtuse term in this setting. It could be an inspiring song played by a bard, an invention created by a gadgeteer, a special kind of ammunition crafted by a marksman, or a manifestation of inner power summoned by a vindicator.
***Legend.*** Creations marked with the (R) Tag means the creation can be used as a routine.
