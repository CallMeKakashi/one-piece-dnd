### Serpent Armor (Serpent Scale)

This set of armor has been crafted from the remains of a rare species of a snake whose scales were tough as steel, but as light as leather.
This armor acts like a set of scale mail and is of uncommon rarity. However, instead of like regular scale mail, you may add your full dexterity modifier to your AC instead of just 2. In addition, it doesn't grant disadvantage on stealth checks.
