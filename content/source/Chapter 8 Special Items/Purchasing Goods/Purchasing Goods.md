## Purchasing Goods

When the party has a large amount of extra berries at their disposal, it should come as no surprise that players would want to purchase high quality items, especially if they lack the means of crafting them.
This section is meant to help DMs handle buying and selling special items, wheter they'd be weapons, equipment, consumables, etc. We'll cover both general prices and availability of various goods. It is important to note that these prices are guidelines and may not be the exact prices your DM uses.
