### Availability of Goods

Now, despite the prices being known, the actual availability of such goods will depend greatly on the location and supply from where the purchase was made. For example, just because you have the money to purchase a devil fruit, you usually won't be able to buy one at any run of the mill store. You may have to seek a private auction, or even in an underground market, and even then it is a toss up if the seller even owns the ones you are looking for.
DMs should be mindful that the inventory of a market must match the means of the merchant, and that not everything is going to be in any store. Players should also be aware that they cannot buy everything, especially if they don't know where that thing may be sold.
Also one thing to note, all shopping interactions should happen on session time and be fully roleplayed, and not something you do out of the session.
