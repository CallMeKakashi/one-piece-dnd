### Prices of Goods

When making prices, it can be easy to accidently make goods dirt cheap or unreasonably expensive. Making goods too cheap can throw a party out of balance very quickly, and making goods too expensive makes every descision too costly. Below are general price guides for various goods such as weapons, armor, consumables, devil fruits, and more.
#### Weapons and Ammo
Special weapons and ammunition, such as ranked swords, all come at a high cost when purchased, either due to the difficulty acquiring such high quality wares, be it finding or crafting. Prices for each are displayed in the table below. If the weapons are cursed, that may increase or decrease the price depending on the nature of the curse.
##### Ranked Weapons
| Rank | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Grade (+1)  | 5 Million Berries |
| Skillful Grade (+2)  | 50 Million Berries |
| Great Grade (+3) | 500 Million Berries |
| Supreme Grade (+3/Black Blade) | At least 2 Billion Berries |
##### Special Ammo
| Rank | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| +1 Ammo (10)  | 5 Million Berries |
| +2 Ammo (10)  | 50 Million Berries |
| +3 Ammo (10) | 500 Million Berries |
> ##### Ranked Items and Size
> _One Piece_ is known for the disproportionally large characters, most of which also wield weapons. In some cases these weapons trade users, and despite their vast difference in size, the weapon remains fully functional. For example, Zoro, Enma, and Oden. Enma in Oden's hands is taller than Zoro, yet Enma seems to shrink to fit Zoro's size.
>
> In order to rectify this, let it be known that ranked weapons and other special items will be able to be wielded by any humanoid, regardless of size (excepts giants). This will not affect the damage dice size as high ranking weapons would most likely already do that.
#### Armor and Shields
Specially crafted armors and shields are very costly, especially the heavier variants. With high defense comes even higher prices.
##### Special Armor
| Rank | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| +1 Armor  | 300 Million Berries + Base Armor Cost |
| +2 Armor  | 1 Billion Berries + Base Armor Cost |
| +3 Armor | 3 Billion Berries + Base Armor Cost |
##### Special Shields
| Rank | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| +1 Shield | 5 Million Berries |
| +2 Shield | 50 Million Berries |
| +3 Shield | 500 Million Berries |
#### Consumables
Since consumables vary to great degrees, determining the general cost to purchase such items would greatly vary. Costs can be split between two types of consumables, instant and continuous. Instant consumables are ones that give benefits which happen once consumed, such as a Medkit (Small Healing Potion). Continuous consumables are ones that last 1 minute or longer, like Adrenaline (Potion of Speed).
Most instant consumables range from as low as 200,000 Berries to 20,000,000 Berries or more, depending on the effect. For example, a Small Medkit that recovers 2d4+2 hit points would be on the lower end, whereas something like a Supreme Medkit that recovers 10d4+20 hit points would be on the higher end.
Continuous consumables are more pricy as their effects can be more substantial, such as giving creation effects, and even increasing ability scores to high levels for a prolonged period. Prices would range from 2,000,000 Berries to 200,000,000 Berries.
Consumable prices and also be lowered if they have side effects. For example, a potion of speed that gives a level of exhaustion at the end of the duration would decrease the cost.
#### Apparatuses and Spell Scrolls
Apparatuses, or creation focuses, are the equivalent of a +1 weapon for creativity users, granting them a +1 bonus to their creation save DCs and creation attack rolls. Spell Scrolls, as previously covered, serve as flavored means of storage for creations such as medicine to contain medic creations, allowing anyone to use them, even if they normally aren't casters. As such, both items have a relatively high cost.
##### Apparatuses
| Rank | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| +1 Apparatus | 5 Million Berries |
| +2 Apparatus | 50 Million Berries |
| +3 Apparatus | 500 Million Berries |
##### Creation Scrolls
| Level | Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Trick (5) | 500,000 Berries |
| 1st level | 1 Million Berries |
| 2nd level | 2 Million Berries |
| 3rd level | 5 Million Berries |
| 4th level | 10 Million Berries |
| 5th level | 20 Million Berries |
| 6th level | 25 Million Berries |
| 7th level | 30 Million Berries |
| 8th level | 50 Million Berries |
| 9th level | 100 Million Berries |
#### Devil Fruits
Pricing devil fruits in particular can be difficult, especially depending on the types. Luckily here are a few estimates for each type of fruit, but it is important to keep in mind that the values can fluctuate immensely. Depending on the fruit, it could as low as 100 Million, or as high as 5 Billion, this is especially true for paramecias.
