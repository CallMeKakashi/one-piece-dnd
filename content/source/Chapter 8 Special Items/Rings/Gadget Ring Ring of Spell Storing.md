### Gadget Ring (Ring of Spell Storing)

This rare item holds the components to hold creations within them, allowing the wearer to utilize them.
This ring stores creations built into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of creations at a time.
Any creature can add a creation of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the creation is used. The creation has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the creation, the creation is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the creation determines how much space it uses.
While wearing this ring, you can use any creation stored in it. The creation uses the slot level, creativity save DC, creation attack bonus, and creativity ability of the original activator, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the creation. The creation activated from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
