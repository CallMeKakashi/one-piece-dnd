### Tools

Tools are the apparatus that enables the creation of the item. Depending on the nature of the item being crafted, different tools may be utilized. Every day spent crafting an item requires a tool check, DC is dependent on the difficulty of the task, as determined by the DM. Successful checks maintain progress, failures on checks cause progress to halt but don't undo progress. Critical successes in crafting checks count as multiple days of progress, and critical fails remove a day of progress.
