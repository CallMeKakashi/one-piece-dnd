### Materials

Crafting special items is not free. The cost would likely be different for each item, but for sake of simplicity, below is a chart that denotes the cost in terms of item rarity, though you do not need to follow it as it is simply a guideline.
Despite the costs of crafting items, there are ways to reduce the costs. Some items may substitute, or even require valuable materials in place of Berry cost, for example defeating a cybernetic captain and using his cybernetics as materials for a new weapon.
In addition, certain roles and classes have abilities that reduce the time and cost of crafting items. Specifically the Mastercraft Novice feature of Gadgeteer, the Medical Expertise Feature of Medic, and the Routine Care Feature of the Doctor role, each can halve the cost of crafting their respective items.
##### Crafting Cost
| Crafting Rarity | Berry Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Common  | 1 Million Berries |
| Uncommon  | 5 Million Berries |
| Rare | 50 Million Berries |
| Very Rare | 500 Million Berries |
| Legendary | 5 Billion Berries |
