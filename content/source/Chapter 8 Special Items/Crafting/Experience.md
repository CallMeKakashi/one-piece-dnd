### Experience

Experience in particular is if the character knows to craft such items. This experience can be gained throughout the game or started depending on one's class, role, or background.
Though as long as they have the proficiency in the tools and enough backstory, anyone can craft.
#### Crafting Classes
**Gunslinger Fighters.** These gunslingers can craft items associated with weaponry such as firearms, cannons, modifications to existing weapons, special ammunition, and even explosives.
***Gadgeteers, Gadget Knight Fighters, Arms Dealer Fighters, and Gadget Tricksters.*** Those who work with gadgets can create most of anything in the form of gadgets. Whether it'd be their creations stored into gadgets (spell scrolls), weapons, armor, permanent versions of their modifications, and more.
***Forgemaster and Cannoneer Barbarians.*** Both these Barbarian subclasses can craft anything that is weapon or armor adjacent.
***Marksmen.*** Marksmen are capable of using either dials, plants, or other kinds of tricks to act as storage for their creations (spell scrolls), and can create and modify new weaponry.
***Bards.*** Bards can imbue their guiding charm and inspiring soul into their art forms, such as storing their creations in a poem that can be sung, or a jovial painting (spell scrolls).
***Medics.*** The specialized medics are capable of using their chemical and medical knowledge to create and store their most potent medicines for later use (spell scrolls), or perhaps store them in drugs (potions).
#### Crafting Roles and Backgrounds
***Shipwrights.*** With the role and/or background, shipwrights can work with both metal and wood, allowing them the ability to craft armor and weaponry.
***Doctors.*** Those with the Doctor role and/or background are just as capable as Medics to craft potent medicines and drugs (potions) to cure their allies.
***Blacksmiths.*** Those with the blacksmith background have worked with metal all their life, granting them the ability to craft weapons and armor.
#### Permanent Haki-Imbuement
Those with an affinity to either Armament or Observation Haki have the potential to infuse their haki into a single weapon permanently, creating a Black Blade, or a White Weapon.
Achieving this is less of a crafting ability, but more of a critical story component for said character.
