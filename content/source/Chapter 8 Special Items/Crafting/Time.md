### Time

One of the biggest limiting factors of crafting is time. Some more simple items can take days, while others can take weeks, months even.
Much like costs, the time an item takes to craft depends greatly on the item. In addition, much like with costs, the features of Gadgeteer, Medic, and the Doctor Role can reduce this time by either half or a quarter it would normally take.
Another thing to note, the crafting process might speed up with additional help. Perhaps 2 Gadgeteers working together on the same object would greatly reduce the time.
Lastly, the table below is yet again a guideline, and should not be the one size fits all ruling.
##### Crafting Time
| Crafting Rarity | Crafting Time |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Common  | 4 days |
| Uncommon  | 20 days |
| Rare | 100 days |
| Very Rare | 500 days |
| Legendary | 1,000 days |
