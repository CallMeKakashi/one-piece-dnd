You call forth a medium swarm of tiny beasts to come to your aid. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This swarm uses the Gathered Swarm stat block. When you use this creation, choose a group of animals: Rodents, Winged, Insects, or Fish. The swarm is made of beasts that resemble animals of the chosen group, which determines certain traits in its stat block. For example, a swarm of Rodents could be made of rats, Winged can be made up of ravens or bats, or a swarm of Insects could be made up of spiders or mantises. The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the creation ends.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

*2nd-level illusion*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the creation ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can dismiss the illusory duplicates as a free action.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the creation’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The creation ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this creation if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
When you use this creation, you skillfully reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you forgets everything you said within the last minute. Those creatures then remember that you actually said the words you speak as the verbal component of the creation.
#### Pass Without a Trace
*2nd-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (some ashes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
You mask yourself and your companions from detection. For the duration, you exude an invisible, 30ft aura. Each creature of your choice, within the aura (can include yourself), has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, can’t be tracked except by magical means, and leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
#### Phantasmal Force
*2nd-level illusion*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This creation has no effect on undead or constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creativity save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the creation ends.
While a target is affected by the creation, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall; it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

*2nd-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation using a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours. When you use this creation using a creation slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 24 hours.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, choose Strength or Dexterity, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use the chosen ability modifier until the creation ends. At the end of each of their turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this using a creation slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d8 for each slot.
#### Sandstorm

As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction.

The creation enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
An unimbued or mastercraft object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the creation’s area.

You create a plant to aid you. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This creation uses the Spawned Plant stat block. When you use this creation, choose a plant: Tree, Flower, Fungus, Vine. The type determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the creation ends.
The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 3rd level or higher, use the higher level wherever the creation’s level appears in the stat block.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the creation is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 3rd level, the duration increases to 1 hour with concentration. With a 4th level slot, the creation lasts 8 hours with concentration. With a 5th level slot, the creation lasts until it is destroyed.

#### Suggestion
*2nd-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a drop of oil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Obviously harmful activities such as asking the creature to stab itself, or outlandish and out of character behavior for the target such as forcing intercourse with someone they have never met ends the creation.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the creation ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the creation expires, the activity isn’t preformed.
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the creation also ends.
#### Thunder Beat

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, on a failure, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against creatures other than yourself for the duration. The target can remake the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the creation on a successful save.

#### Tiny Servant (R)

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours
You touch one Tiny, nonmastercraft object that isn’t attached to another object or a surface and isn’t being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the Creation ends, if the creature drops to 0 hit points, or if you use this creation again. See the stat block at the end of this description for its statistics.
As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this creation, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.
When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 3rd level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 2nd.

On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
An affected creature is aware of the creation and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The wind has the following effects:
* It deafens you and other creatures in its area.
* It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
* The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
* The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.

#### Web
*2nd-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
You produce a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the creation ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your creation save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
#### Woebegone

Whenever the creature takes damage, they can repeat the Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. Each target must be within 30 feet of each other.

You flick your wrist, causing one object in your hand to vanish. The object, which only you can be holding and can weigh no more than 5 pounds, is transported to an extradimensional space, where it remains for the duration.
Until the creation ends, you can use your action to summon the object to your free hand, and you can use your action to return the object to the extradimensional space. An object still in the pocket plane when the creation ends appears in your space, at your feet.
