## Creations Descriptions

In the world of _One Piece_, fantastical abilities are not unheard of among pirates and marines both. Specific individuals sometimes develop abilities that stand above the norm. These powers are typically referred to as their "creations" in the broadest of terms.
A creation could be anything that holds significantly more power than one might think. A song that inspires people to fight beyond their limits is as much of a creation as a medical drug that boosts performance if the results are the same.
