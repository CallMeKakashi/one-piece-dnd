### Gadgeteers - Brains over Brawn

Gadgeteers are inventors and tacticians that build extraordinary contraptions and gadgets. They can be anything from a hobby tinkerer to a revolutionary commander.
Gadgeteers are set apart from their peers by their ability to create just about anything they can dream of. Their creations can be support tools to aid their allies, utilitarian gadgets designed for exploration, or customized weapons of war that spew fire, ice, and lightning upon their enemies.
