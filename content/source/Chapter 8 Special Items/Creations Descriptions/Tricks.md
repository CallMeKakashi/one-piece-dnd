- **Target:** A creature or object within range
- **Components:** V, S

You hurl a blast of purely destructive acid at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged creation attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage. Small, inanimate plants within 5ft of the target are destroyed.
Additionally, you can manipulate the acid to create tiny sensory effects as an action.

**At Higher Levels.** At higher levels you can choose to either make one big blast, or multiple smaller blasts. For the single blast, this trick's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

#### Temporary Trick
*enchantment trick*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30ft
- **Target:** See text
- **Components:** S, M (a tiny piece of cloth)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it (no action required) or use this trick again.
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the creation ends. The sound cannot be loud enough to deafen or deal damage.
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. The image cannot obscure a creature's vision to the point of blinding them.
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

Additionally, you can manipulate sound to create tiny sensory effects as an action.
**At Higher Levels.** At higher levels you can choose to either make one big blast, or multiple smaller blasts.

For the multiple blasts, two blasts at 5th level, three blasts at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones.

#### Trap Sense
*divination trick*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You sense the presence of any trap within range. A trap, for the purpose of this creation, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the creation would sense an area affected by the alarm creation or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
This creation merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

* Brass: When you hit a creature with this weapon, once per turn, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure.
* String: This weapon has the reach property.
* Woodwind: This weapon can also be used to make ranged attacks, dealing piercing damage, range (60/180), and it ignores half and three-quarters cover.

The shapes last for 1 hour, and you can have up to three of them active at a time, and you can dismiss some or all as an action.
**At Higher Levels.** At higher levels you can choose to either make one big blast, or multiple smaller blasts.

- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, or 1 hour
You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage. The water is still affected by gravity and will fall at the end of your turn, so it cannot be used to weaken or paralyze devil fruit users, unless that user is also in a large enough container.
* You cause the water to form into tiny simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.
* You can launch a concentrated blast of water against a creature you can see within range. You make a ranged creation attack against that creature. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
If you use this trick multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss each effect, no action required.
**At Higher Levels.** This trick’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
#### Whisper
*transmutation trick*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You whisper a message towards a creature within range. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
You can use this trick through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Creative silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the trick.
