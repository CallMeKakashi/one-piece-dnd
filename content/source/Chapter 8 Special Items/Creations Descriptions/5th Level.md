### 5th Level

#### Animate Objects
*5th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the creation ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
##### Animated Object Statistics
| Size | HP | AC | Attack | Ability Scores |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 20 | 18 | +8 to hit, 1d4+4 damage | Str: 4, Dex:18 |
| Small  | 25 | 16 | +7 to hit, 1d8+3 damage | Str: 8, Dex:16 |
| Medium | 45 | 14 | +6 to hit, 2d6+2 damage | Str: 12, Dex:14 |
| Large | 50 | 12 | +7 to hit, 2d10+3 damage | Str: 16, Dex:10 |
| Huge | 80 | 10 | +8 to hit, 2d12+4 damage | Str: 18, Dex:6 |
An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determine by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the objects lack legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determine by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.
**At Higher Levels.** If you use this creation with a creation slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the creation’s duration.
Since this creation induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.

You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you’ve halted.
**Gusts.** A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction that you choose. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.
**Downdraft.** You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
**Updraft.** You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube’s bottom edge. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature", "Run over there", or "Fetch that object". If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the creation. If the saving throw succeeds, the creation ends.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a 6th-level creation slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level creation slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a creation slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this creation and cause the weapon to emit a deadly burst. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 of the chosen damage type, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
When you use this creation and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.
**Clenched Fist.** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee creation attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 + your creative ability modifier bludgeoning damage.
**Forceful Hand.** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your creative ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
**Grasping Hand.** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage.
**Interposing Hand.** The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation using a slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from clenched fist and grasping hand increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 5th.
#### Greater Restoration

#### Illusionary Monster
*5th-level illusion*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a Huge illusion of a monster in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The appearence is up to your discretion, be it a giant dragon, or some kind of titanic shadow. The illusion lasts for the creation’s duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.
When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space.
When you create the illusion, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, or thunder. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 6d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The illusion is so convincing that is is tangible, but attacks miss it automatically. it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the monster can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it.
**At Higher Levels.** If you use this creation with a creation slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 each slot level above 5th.
#### Immolate

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 9d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the creation’s duration.
The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the creation ends on a successful one. These flames can’t be extinguished by anything less than a creation.

On a failed save, the target takes 4d12 necrotic damage, and until the creation ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal 4d12 necrotic damage to the target. The creation ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the creation’s range, or if the target has total cover from you. Whenever the creation deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 5th.

The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

- **Target:** Any number of creatures that you can see within range
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours
This creation allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, temporary appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this creation.
The creation disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the disguise is up to you. The creation lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

#### Necrosis Surge
*5th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a bone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You assail one creature you can see within range with necrosis. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as an undead at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. After that creature is slain, the undead dies. Statistics for the undead are in the Animate Dead creation.
If you target an undead with this creation, the target doesn’t make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.
#### Programmed Illusion
*5th-level illusion*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you activate the creation how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.
#### Purifying Flames
*5th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Target:** 10-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
A vertical column of fire roars down from the in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage and 5d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels: When you use this creaiton with a creation slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
#### Raise Dead
*5th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (medical supplies worth at least 5,000,000 Berries, which the creation consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 24 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
This creation also neutralizes any poison and cures diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This creation doesn’t, however, remove particularly powerful diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to activation of the creation, they take effect when the creature returns to life. This creation can’t return an undead creature to life.
This creation closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival – its head, for instance – the creation automatically fails. That is not to say all hope is lost as limbs can be reattached, and artificial organs can be made.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
#### Scrying
*5th-level divination*
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 10,000,000 berries)

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re using this creation, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this creation against it again for 24 hours.
On a failed save, the creation allows you to see and hear the area within 10 feet of the target, as if you were there. Your senses move with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this creation. When you do, your senses don’t move.

You alter your ranged weapon so it produces an endless supply of non-mastercraft ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.
On each of your turns until the creation ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with the ranged weapon used. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your weapon replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of non-mastercraft ammunition.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can’t be affected by this creation. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws (except the one to end the effect).

The creature continues attempting to attack the target, repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is shunted to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in he space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

- **Range:** 120 feet

The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
A creature that ends its turn in the wall’s area takes 4d8 radiant damage.
Until the creation ends, you can use an action to launch a beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged creation attack. On a hit, the target takes 6d8 radiant damage.

Choose a point you can see within range. The trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the creation ends.
