### 9th Level

#### Blade of Disaster
*9th-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you activate this creation, you can make up to two melee creation attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee creation attacks with it again.
The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including the Wall of Force creation.
#### Invulnerability
*9th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (Medical supplies worth at least 5,000,000 Berries, which the creation consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You are immune to all damage until the creation ends.
#### Mass Polymorph
*9th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.
Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, as if the Polymorph creation was used on them, lasting until the end of the duration, or until their individual hit points in their beast forms reach 0.
#### Meteor Swarm
*9th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Constitution saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
The creation damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
#### Prismatic Wall
*9th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall – up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick – centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the creation fails, and your action and the creation slot are wasted.
The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the creation. An Anti-Creation Field has no effect on it.
##### Prismatic Wall Table
| Color | Effect |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Red  | The creature takes 10d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, unimbued ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. |
| Orange | The creature takes 10d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, unimbued ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. |
| Yellow | The creature takes 10d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. |
| Green | The creature takes 10d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Secret Passage creation, or another creation of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. |
| Blue | The creature takes 10d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. |
| Indigo | On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, creations can’t be activated through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a creation of 5th level or higher. |
| Violet | On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is blinded until the Greater Restoration creation is used on them at 9th level. This layer is destroyed by a Deactivate Creation creation or similar creation of equal or higher level that can end creations and similar effects. |
#### Psychic Scream
*9th-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You unleash the power of your mind to blast the intellect of up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. Creatures that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are unaffected.
Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d8 psychic damage and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned. If a target is killed by this damage, its head explodes, assuming it has one.
A stunned target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the stunning effect ends.
#### Shapechange
*9th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial worth at least 15,000,000 Berries)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Creativity trait.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature, If the creature has the same proficiency as you, and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hitpoints, you aren't knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.
During this creation's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.
#### Time Ravage
*9th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90ft
- **Components:**  V, S, M (an hourglass filled with diamond dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 12d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved.
Nothing short of the Greater Restoration creation is used with a 9th-level creation slot, or certain devil fruits that allow for age manipulation can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.
#### Time Stop
*9th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 5 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.
Creatures frozen in time count as incapacitated, even if they are immune to the condition normally, automatically fail all saving throws, ability contests, and attacks against them are made at advantage.
#### True Polymorph
*9th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
Choose one creature or non-mastercraft object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a non-mastercraft object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this creation for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.
An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this creation.
This creation can't affect a target that has 0 hit points.
**Creature into Creature.**
If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, use creations, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
**Object into Creature.**
You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.
If the creation becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.
**Creature into Object.**
If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object's size is no larger than the creature's size. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the creation ends and it returns to its normal form.
#### Ultimate Heal
*9th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore all hit points for up to six creatures of your choice within range. Creatures healed by this creation are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This creation has no effect on undead or constructs.
