### Savants - Power from Within

Savants are extremely rare individuals that have developed fantastical power from within. Most of the time, this power comes as a result of genetic modification or tampering, however, sometimes it's simply a manifestation of a person's passion and spirit.
Limited in scope compared to other forms of creativity, savants do not need gadgets or paraphernalia for their creations, instead it is a power that comes from within. Unlike other creative minds, savants learn a few specific creations based on what their soul mirrors.
# Creation Descriptions
Creativtiy is a key mechanic for many classes and abilities how they interact, battle, and navigate this great, wide, and wacky world. However, there can be improvements from the previous system.
While most of the official D&D 5e spells can be easily flavored into Creations, some required some mechanical changes to better fit into the World of *One Piece*, or even the addition of entirely new creations. This is especially true for mechanically flawed Creations and Tricks, and spells that rely on dealing "magical" damage, which no longer exists in this system.
