### 7th Level

#### Cause Death
*7th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 10d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A humanoid killed by this creation rises at the start of your next turn as an undead that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability. The undead uses the statistics from the Animate Dead creation.
#### Charged Fireball
*7th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of light flashes from you, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the creation ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The creations’s base damage is 14d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creation ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the creation ends, and the bead explodes.
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
#### Dry Bones
*7th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sponge)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren’t affected, and plants and creatures similar to water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 14d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### Firestorm
*7th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this creation.
#### Force Cage
*7th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lock)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any creations used inside or outside of the area.
When you use this creation, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can't leave it by non-creation means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that ability to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the creation or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
This creation can't be deactivated by the Deactivate Creation creation.
#### Foresight
*7th-level divination*
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** A willing creature
- **Components:** V, S, M (A hummingbird feather)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.
This creation immediately ends if you use it again before its duration ends.
#### Greater Heal
*7th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
A wave of healing energy washes over a creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This creation has no effect on undead or constructs.
#### Magnificent Mansion
*7th-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of marble)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you use this creation can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this creation dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the creation ends, any creatures or objects inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.
#### Pain
*7th-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You cause waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is wrought with intense pain. On a success, the target is not affected.
While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to use a creation, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the activation and the creation is wasted.
A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.
#### Prismatic Spray
*7th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60ft cone)
- **Target:** Each creature in a 60-foot cone
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
Eight multicolored rays flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.
1-Red: The target takes 12d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
2-Orange: The target takes 12d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

5-Blue: The target takes 12d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6-Indigo: On a failed save, the target is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
7-Violet: On a failed save, the target is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is blinded for the next 24 hours.
8-Special: The target is struck twice. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.
#### Storm of Vengeance
*7th-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Sight
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.
Each round you maintain concentration on this creatopn, the storm produces different effects on your turn.
##### Storm of Vengeance After Round 1

| 5-10 | Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area whether mundane or the result of a creation or item. |
