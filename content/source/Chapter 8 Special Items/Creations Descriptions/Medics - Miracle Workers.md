### Medics - Miracle Workers

Medics are practitioners of the healing arts, but in this practice lies also an intimate knowledge of lethal substances. Most medics often find work as doctors on both pirate and navy ships.
A medic's creations are typically less flashy than their contemporaries: Simple medicinal pills and humble concoctions that hold the restorative or harmful power. Medics use their creations to heal the wounded, empower allies with performance-enhancing medicine, weaken enemies with enfeebling chemicals, and create illusory images from hallucinogenic concoctions.
