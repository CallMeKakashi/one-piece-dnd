### 3rd Level

#### Ability Boost
*3rd-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Target:** A friendly creature within range
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
You invoke the true potential in one of your allies, fueled by your own talents to push them towards success. Choose a friendly creature within range, and choose one of their physical ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. The chosen ability score becomes equal to your creative ability score for the duration of the creation, if it were not already higher. For example, if you are a bard and have a Charisma score of 18 and use it on an ally with a Dexterity of 12, that creature’s Dexterity becomes 18 for the duration.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this using a creation slot of 5th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes with concentration. When you use this using a creation slot of 7th level, the duration increases to 1 hour with concentration. When you use this using a creation slot of 9th level, the duration increases to 24 hours without concentration.
#### Animate Dead
*3rd-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a corpse)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
This creation creates an undead servant. Choose a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid or beast within range. Your creation imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes an undead of your choice, either Hulking, Rotten, or Skeletal. The statistics for each are detailed at the bottom of this creation's description.
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this creature if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain the control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this creation on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. You can only have one active Animated Undead, unless you have a feature that says otherwise.
If the Spare the Dying trick is used on the Animated Undead for 10 minutes, it regains 2d6 hit points.

Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the creation ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

#### Grand Tower
*3rd-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a fragment of stone, wood, or other building material)
- **Duration:** Until destroyed
You construct a two-story tower made of stone, wood, or similar suitably sturdy materials. The tower can be round or square in shape. Each level of the tower is 10 feet tall and has an area of up to 100 square feet. Access between levels consists of a simple ladder and hatch. Each level takes one of the following forms, chosen by you when you use this creation:
* A bedroom with a bed, chairs, chest, and functional fireplace
* A study with desks, books, bookshelves, parchments, ink, and ink pens
* A dining space with a table, chairs, functional fireplace, containers, and cooking utensils
* A lounge with couches, armchairs, side tables and footstools
* A washroom with toilets, washtubs, a brazier, and sauna benches
* An observatory with a telescope and maps of the night sky
* An unfurnished, empty room
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the tower can have one additional story for each slot level beyond 3rd.
#### Haste
*3rd-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the creation ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
When the creation ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
#### Hidden Trigger
*3rd-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder worth at least 2,000,000 Berries, which the creation consumes)
- **Duration:** Until deactivated or triggered
When you use this creation, you set a trigger that either harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the trigger.
If you choose a surface, the trigger can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you used this creation, the trigger is broken, and the creation ends without being triggered.
The trigger is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the creation when you use it. For triggers inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the trigger, removing another object covering the trigger, approaching within a certain distance of the trigger, or manipulating the object on which the trigger is inscribed.
For triggers placed within an object, the most common include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing the trigger. Once a trigger is activated, this creation ends. You can further refine the trigger so the creation activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind, etc.
You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the creation, such as those who say a certain password.
When you place the trigger, choose explosives or creative triggers.
**Explosive Trigger.** When activated, the creation erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trigger. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trigger), or half as much damage on a successful one.
**Creative Trigger.** You can store a prepared creation of 3rd level or lower in the trigger by using it as part of creating the trigger. The creation must target a single creature or an area. The creation being stored has no immediate effect when use in this way. When the trigger is activated, the stored creation is used. If the creation has a target, it targets the creature that activated the trigger. If the creation affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the creation summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the creation requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive trigger increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a creative trigger, you can store any creation of up to the same level as the slot you use for the Hidden Trigger.
#### Hypnosis

- **Components:** V, S, M (a light source)

Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this creation, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
The creation ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
#### Intellect Fortress
*3rd-level abjuration*

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
**At Higher Levels**. When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
#### Locate Creature
*3rd-level divination*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.
The creation can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or seaking), so long as you have seen such a creature up close – within 30 feet – at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph creation, this creation doesn’t locate the creature.
**At Higher Levels**. When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level, it increases the sense from 1,000 feet to 1 mile. When you use this creation with a 5th level creation slot, the sense increases from 1 mile to 10 miles.
#### Major Image
*3rd-level illusion*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 6th level or higher, the creation lasts until deactivated, without requiring your Concentration.
#### Mass Healing Word
*3rd-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the creation’s duration. When you use the creation — and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter — you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you.
Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, stone, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the creation, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.
Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.
Similarly, this creation doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.
#### Plant Growth
*3rd-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the creation’s area from being affected.
If you use this creation over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

If the creature attempts to use a creation with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the creation doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the creation is wasted.

#### Wall of Sand
*3rd-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You conjure up a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the creation ends.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and are shunted to the opposite end of the wall from you.
The wall blocks line of sight but not movement. A creature is blinded while in the wall’s space, must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves there.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
#### Wall of Water
*3rd-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the creation ends. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and are shunted to the opposite end of the wall from you.
Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Attacks and creations that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
#### Water Breathing (R)
*3rd-level transmutation (routine)*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
This creation grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the creation ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.
This doesn't prevent devil fruit users from being paralyzed in water, but it will prevent them from drowning.
#### Water Walk (R)
*3rd-level transmutation (routine)*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
This creation grants the ability to move across any liquid surface – such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava – as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.
If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the creation carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.
#### Wind Wall
*3rd-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and are shunted to the opposite end of the wall from you.
The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bullets, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures with a gaseous form can’t pass through it.
