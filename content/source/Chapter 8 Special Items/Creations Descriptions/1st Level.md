- **Duration:** Instantaneous
You create a tiny mechanical servant to aid you. It appears in an unoccupied space within range. This creation uses the Created Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. The appearance of the servant can be that of any non-humanoid creature, or toy. For example, its appearance could be a cat or a racing car. You can't have more than one Created Servant at a time, and using this creation again destroys the current Created Servant.
The Created Servant is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you), otherwise it will take the Dodge action and use its movement to avoid danger.
When the Created Servant drops to 0 hit points, it becomes inactive until you can spend 10 minutes with your material components, after which it is restored with all its hit points, which can also be restored when you finish a long rest. A creature using the Mend trick on the Created Servant will also restore 2d6 of its hit points.
As an action, you can temporarily deactivate your Servant, rendering it inactive. When temporarily deactivated, you can use an action to reactivate the Servant, becoming active again. While it is deactivated this way, you can spend an action to change its appearance, as long as the Created Servant is within range. This can be done while repairing it with your tinker's tools. Whenever the Created Servant is rendered inactive, its speed becomes 0, it'll ignore any verbal commands and it drops in its space anything it was wearing or carrying, but can still perceive the world around it.
**At Higher Levels.** When you use this creation with a creation slot of 2nd level or higher, use the higher level where the creation’s level appears in the stat block.

For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your creation save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.
