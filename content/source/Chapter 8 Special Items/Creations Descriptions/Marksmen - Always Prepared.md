### Marksmen - Always Prepared

Marksmen are experts in their field that enhance their uncanny aim with the use of specialized ammunition, customizations, and easy-to-use gadgets.
Marksmen split their focus between creativity and combat, resulting in a smaller arsenal than gadgeteers. Instead, they specialize in creations designed for battle, such as pop greens and dials, allowing them to rain bullets over large areas, fire napalm onto enemies, or trap them in tar.
