### Devil Fruits and the Environment

Devil fruits interact with the environment in many ways. The most notable being with standing liquids and seastone, and their ability to reincarnate.
#### Devil Fruit Users in Liquids
When a devil fruit user is partially submerged in running water to its knees, it suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until contact is broken.
If the water additionally reaches its waist, its speed is reduced by half as well, and they lose the ability to activate its devil fruit.
If a devil fruit user is submerged in water beyond their waist, it becomes paralyzed until moved onto dry land, and immediately begins sinking at a speed of 30 feet per turn until it reaches the bottom.
If they have the means to breathe underwater, that still applies, such as a respiration device, or being a fishman. However, you still are subject to all the debuffs when directly submersed.
#### Devil Fruit Users and Seastone
When a weapon made with seastone deals damage, the target, if they are a devil fruit user, must make a Constitution Saving Throw, DC 20. On a failed save, they lose the ability to activate any of their devil fruit abilities, repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a successful save, they can use their devil fruit abilities as normal. This effect is continuous if the weapon is embedded into them, like a seastone bullet.
If armament haki is utilized to reduce the damage from a seastone weapon, or to grant advantage on the Constitution Saving Throw, the target automatically succeeds.
Seastone restraints like handcuffs and nets are commonly utilized by the marines when hunting devil fruit users. Seastone handcuffs are manacles, that cannot take damage or be broken unless the creature has the Color of Armament Master haki ability. While a creature is bound by these handcuffs they suffer the waist-deep weakness of Ocean's Scorn, ending when freed. A bound creature, while in combatm, can attempt to make the Constitution Saving Throw at the end of their turns.
#### Reincarnation
Another interesting aspect of devil fruits is their ability to reincarnate in place of another fruit in the world after their user is killed. Though some have found ways to utilize this reincarnation system to their advantage.
In character, at the start, most would not know that devil fruits reincarnate to one of the nearest fruits, and even so there are fruits everywhere in the One Piece world, so it would likely still be quite rare to find.
Devil fruits reincarnate when the user flat-out dies, meaning when there is no hope to bring them back. Players that die with their devil fruits, but are brought back with Creations such as Revivify and Raise Dead, or any class ability that allows dead creatures to be brought to life, can keep their devil fruits. This can be flavored as they have the will to keep persisting while their allies perform life-saving surgery on them, much like Law helping bring Luffy from the brink after fighting Akainu.
Additionally, devil fruits are tied to the user's body and not their mind, as shown with Law's heart switching surgery. Therefore, when a devil fruit user dies, and is brought back via the Clone creation, they do not have their devil fruit ability.
