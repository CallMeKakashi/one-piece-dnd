### Multiple Devil Fruit Rules

It has not been outright confirmed yet, but making it so that someone instantly dies when they eat two devil fruits is too much.
In short, characters will try to abuse it. In character what happens can remain a mystery, but until more information is revealed it is for the best to make it so if a devil fruit user eats another devil fruit, it simply wastes the fruit, and it reincarnates elsewhere.
Though if you intend to replicate a certain antagonist with multiple fruits, you are free to ignore this.
