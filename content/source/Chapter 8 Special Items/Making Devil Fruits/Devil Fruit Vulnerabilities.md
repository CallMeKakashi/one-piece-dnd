### Devil Fruit Vulnerabilities

There seems to be this common pitfall for Dungeon Masters that believe granting a chracter vulnerability is a balanced feature, wheter it'd be a logia or maybe some kind mythical zoan. Don't do that.
Mechanically, vulnerability to a damage type is extremely debilitating, especially for a player. Think about this, imagine if you were given a fruit that made you vulnerable to fire, one of the most common damage types, and someone throws a fireball at that user that does 35 damage. That character, if they fail, takes a substantial 70 damage, which could kill most people, especially at lower levels.
Now, instead of using vulnerability, try some of the following to replicate weakness: For logias, the damage type that they are weak to is only one (except haki) they can't benefit from any resistance or immunity from their fruit, like a Wood Logia and fire. Perhaps they have a mythical Troll Zoan that grants them the trolls regeneration that fails to function when they take fire or acid damage. Or perhaps they simply take an extra 4 damage of that type each time they take that damage.
This doesn't just apply to players, but also NPCs. Now, some may try to justify giving vulnerabilities by offsetting it with immunities and resistances, but that doesn't change the fact they may still die in one round due to taking double damage.
