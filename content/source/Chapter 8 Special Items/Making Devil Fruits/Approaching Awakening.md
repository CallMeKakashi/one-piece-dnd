### Approaching Awakening

Awakening a devil fruit is much like learning a new skill, it doesn't just happen instantly but in progressive steps. Exhaustive steps, but steps nonetheless. There are a few guidelines, the character needs to have trained with the fruit for a significant amount of time, and can only be attempted in times of great significance, such as combat to save an ally on the brink of death.
Also keep in mind what exactly an awakening entails, utilizing one's fruit in a new way, expanding the range of their abilities. For example, Law and Kid's awakenings enabled them to extend the reach of their fruits, placing a room on his sword, or making a target magnetic instead of magnetizing metal towards yourself.
This effect works similarly between logias, paramecias, and zoans, enabling their user benefit from their awakened abilities to a limtied extent.
##### Awakening Attempt
Beginning at 10th level, you can attempt to channel your will and bypass the limits of your abilities to unlock a new world of possibilities temporarily, at the cost of expending vast stamina.
Before taking an action, describe the what you aim to do, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number in the range equal to your level. you gain the ability to replicate the effects of your awakened fruit temporarily without expending a devil fruit usage. On a success, you gain a level of exhaustion and  you can't use this feature again until the next dawn. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
