## Making Devil Fruits

Devil Fruits are a core part of the _One Piece_ setting, special fruits that grant superpowers upon consumption. There are many things to note when designing devil fruits for use in games.
Don't be over-specific with devil fruits. For example, the difference between a fruit that lets you transform into a hammer, versus a devil fruit that lets you transform into any tool. Oddly specific devil fruits are not fun at all.
