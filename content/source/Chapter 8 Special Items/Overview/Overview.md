## Overview

This section has been made for the express purpose of aiding those who wish to be a Dungeon Master for a _One Piece_ D&D game and want to use this system. To push themselves in the right direction, it is recommended to read this guide. It is also recommended that they have been a Dungeon Master beforehand for the standard 5th edition.
This section covers many aspects of the _One Piece_ world, as well as tips on how to run certain parts of the game. From factors of the environment (travel time and hazards) to Rewards (how to give them), and Crafting (costs and time to craft).
Before we begin, keep in mind these are suggestions. Suggestions that have risen out of multiple successful and failed games using this system to create the best experience possible.
Be aware that this system, while more lenient than the standard 5th edition, is still grounded in rules, unlike other anime systems. Everything matters, there must be consistency to maintain balance. This system, being a 5e system, is more D&D than _One Piece_, but not aggressively so.
