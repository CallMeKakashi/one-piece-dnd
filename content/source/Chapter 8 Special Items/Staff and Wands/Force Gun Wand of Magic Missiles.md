### Force Gun (Wand of Magic Missiles)

This small, uncommon, handheld gadget allows the user to unleash a barrage of bullets made out of nothing but pure force.
This gun has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to use the Missiles creation from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the creation. You can increase the creation slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
The gun regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the gun's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gun loses its charge and becomes an unsalvagable piece of garbage.
