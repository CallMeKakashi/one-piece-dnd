### Defender Field (Staff of Defense)

This small, uncommon, handheld gadget emanates a constant field of protection around the user, blocking attacks that come their way.
While holding the gadget, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
The gadget has 10 charges, which are used to fuel the creations within it. With the gadget in hand, you can use your action to use one of the following creations from the gadget if the creation is on your class's creation list: Gadget Armor (1 charge) or Shield (2 charges). No components are required.
The gadget regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the gadgets' last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gadget loses its charge and becomes an unsalvagable piece of garbage.
