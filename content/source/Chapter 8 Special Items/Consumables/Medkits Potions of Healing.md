### Medkits (Potions of Healing)

A very useful tool for those in combat, and treating wounds, a medkit can serve to prevent a creature from facing death.
When you use a medkit, the target regains hit points. The number of hit points depends on the medkit's rarity, as shown in the Medkits table.
##### Medkits
| Medkit Rarity | HP Regained |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Common  | 2d4 + 2 |
| Uncommon | 4d4 + 4 |
| Rare | 8d4 + 8 |
| Very Rare | 10d4 + 20 |
