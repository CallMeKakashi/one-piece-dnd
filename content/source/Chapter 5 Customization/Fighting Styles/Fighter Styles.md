### Fighter Styles

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
#### Blindfighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within range, unless the creature successfully hides.
#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
#### Dueling
You gain a +2 damage bonus to a weapon held in one hand if you are holding no other weapons.
#### Superior Technique
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.)
You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the dice and must use the higher of the two rolls. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, when you make an opportunity attack, you can attack with both of your weapons.
#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, including you, within your melee range with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your level (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
#### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
#### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
#### Melee Shooter
While you're wielding a ranged weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls and you do not have disadvantage on ranged attacks while a creature is within 5 feet of you.
#### Versatile Fighting
When wielding a weapon with the versatile property with one hand, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls. While wielding a weapon with the versatile property with two hands, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target, including you, that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to reroll the attack roll, and the lowest takes effect. You must be wielding a shield.
