## Fighting Styles

Certain martial classes grant the user a fighting style, representing a user's greater proficiency in a certain method of combat, going beyond merely adding a proficiency bonus.
Only classes that gain the option to choose a fighting style can choose fighting styles within their specified class options below. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
