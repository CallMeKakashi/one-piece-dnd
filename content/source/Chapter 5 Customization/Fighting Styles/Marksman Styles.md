### Marksman Styles

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
#### Blindfighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within range, unless the creature successfully hides.
#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
#### Tonic Tactician
You learn two tricks of your choice from the Medic Creation list. They count as Marksman creations for you, and Wisdom is your creativity ability for them.
#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, when you make an opportunity attack, you can attack with both of your weapons.
#### Gunslinging
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a ranged weapon, you can reroll the dice and must use the higher of the two rolls. The weapon must have the reload property for you to gain this benefit.
#### Melee Shooter
While you're wielding a ranged weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls and you do not have disadvantage on ranged attacks while a creature is within 5 feet of you.
#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, including you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your level (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
#### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
#### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
