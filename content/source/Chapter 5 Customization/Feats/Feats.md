A whip in your hands becomes a deadly weapon. You gain the following benefits:
* You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with whips.
* Whips you wield gain an extra 5ft reach, this stacks with their reach property, giving you a reach of 15ft.
* The damage die of whips you wield increases by one size (1d4 => 1d6).
* When you score a critical hit against a creature that is no more than one size larger than you, you can force that target to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failure, the target becomes grappled. While grappled in this way, the creature is restrained.
