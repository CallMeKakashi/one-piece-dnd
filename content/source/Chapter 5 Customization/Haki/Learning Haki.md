### Learning Haki

The first glimpses of haki are generally discovered when player characters reach 8th level, however, it is best that before then they at least hear about it, or better yet taught it. However, accidental discoveries of haki can and will happen, especially after intense battles with opponents far stronger than yourself.
Typically when haki is achieved, you learn only one, and that one dictates your haki proficiency. People are naturally disposed to one type of haki, a sort of talent if you will. They can still learn multiple types, however.
Every two levels after initially learning haki, characters will gain the option of learning an additional step in a chosen type of haki, perhaps even two if the characters come out of extremely intense and lifespan taxing battles.
