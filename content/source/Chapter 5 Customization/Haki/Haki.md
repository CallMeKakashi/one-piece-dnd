## Haki

Haki is a mysterious power that slumbers deep within each living creature. To most, it is an untapped potential that will never be drawn upon, as few awaken the power within them. Broadly speaking, Haki is not that different from other senses a creature might possess and comes in three distinct types, sometimes referred to as "colors".
***Observation Haki (Kenbonshoku).*** This type grants a person a sort of sixth sense, massively increasing their awareness and giving them the ability to pick up on the presence of nearby creatures. When mastered, this type of Haki can even allow creatures to peer moments into the future, giving them an uncanny ability to evade attacks and danger.
***Armament Haki (Busoshoku).*** This type manifests a person's spirit as an invisible force around their body, protecting or empowering them. Armament Haki is one of the only ways to reliably strike and damage Logia-type devil fruit users, and when mastered it allows a person to project their spirit as black armor, coat their weapons to make them deadlier, and deflect attacks completely.
***Conqueror's Haki (Haoshoku).*** This type is exceedingly rare, only appearing in a few individuals throughout history. Conqueror's Haki is the projection of a person's willpower with such overwhelming force that it can incapacitate weaker beings completely. Conqueror's Haki is unique in that unlike the other two types, it cannot be trained in or forcefully unlocked, but one must possess the innate potential to do so.
