## Fearsome Fortitude

Time and time again, you have trained to be able to withstand certain potent effects that have been thrown your way, enabling your own form of saving grace.
You gain proficiency in one saving throw. Additionally, your hit point maximum increases by a number equal to one roll of your hit dice + your Constitution Modifier, and you gain an extra hit die.
