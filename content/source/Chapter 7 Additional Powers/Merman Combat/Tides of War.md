### Tides of War

When you gain the ability, you learn that you can grab and weaponize water, and how to make a trident's strike especially deadly.
You learn the Water Flow trick, using either your Strength or Dexterity modifier as the creative ability modifier.
As an action, you can grab water and fire it as a blast in the form of a line that is (Your proficiency bonus x 20) long, and 5ft wide. All creatures within this line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw, DC equal to 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. On a failure, they take your (proficiency bonus)d10 bludgeoning and half on a success. On a success, a creature takes only half damage. You can use this feature 3 times per long rest.
In addition, while wielding a trident, the size of the damage dice increases by one size.
