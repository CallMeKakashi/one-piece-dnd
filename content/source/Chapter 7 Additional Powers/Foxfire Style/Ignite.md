### Ignite

When you gain this ability, you can coat your weapon in a destructive layer of fire. When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a Foxfire Point to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage.
At 10th level, you can cause your flames to remain. When you use this feature, instead of igniting one attack, you can ignite all melee weapons you are wielding for 1 minute. For the duration, their melee weapon attacks now deal an extra 1d8 fire damage.
