### Flame Render

When you gain this ability you can cut flames as if they were a tangible substance. As a reaction to being targeted by a fire-based attack/creation, such as the Fireball creation or an attack that deals fire damage, the user can spend a Foxfire Point to cut the flames, reducing the fire damage to 0 and extinguishes any lingering flames that would have been created.
In addition, any creature made of flames (such as a fire elemental), your weapon attacks can bypass all their resistances and immunities to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
