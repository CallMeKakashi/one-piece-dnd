## Foxfire Style

Foxfire Style is a unique sword fighting style that allows the user to use their blade as an apparatus of pyrokinesis, allowing them to burn and slash their enemies, as well as rend even the most potent flames asunder. While it is based in swords, it can be used with any melee weapon you are wielding.
