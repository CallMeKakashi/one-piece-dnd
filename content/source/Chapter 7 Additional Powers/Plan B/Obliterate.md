### Obliterate

As a bonus action you or an ally can cause a mod they’re carrying to explode forcing all creatures (excluding you and/or the triggering ally) within thirty feet to make a Dexterity saving throw against your creation save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice), or half as much on a success. The explosion will propel the user 50 feet in any direction. The mod on the item ends, but is not destroyed.
