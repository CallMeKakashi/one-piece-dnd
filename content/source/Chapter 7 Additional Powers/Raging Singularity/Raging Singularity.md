## Raging Singularity

*Prerequisites: Barbarian class*
When faced with an indomitable threat, a living being has one of two choices: Fight or flight. A barbarian who can exude such primal menace sends out waves of terror while they rage, forcing all their enemies to make the same decision every prey animal must decide. To run from an inevitable threat, or to engage in mortal combat.
