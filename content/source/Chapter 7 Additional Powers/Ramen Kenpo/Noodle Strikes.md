### Noodle Strikes

As long as you have a bag of flour on your person, you can form sharpened noodles as weapons. This attack counts as a melee improvised weapon attack with the finesse, thrown (30/120ft) light properties that deals 1d6 piercing damage.
Additionally, in place of this attack, you can attempt a grapple check, and you can use Acrobatics instead of Athletics to make the grapple.
