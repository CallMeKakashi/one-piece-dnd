# Chapter 7: Additional Powers

There exists additional abilities and power systems present in the One Piece World. These features are a narrative element meant to balance out the abilities of the party.
For example, take a Savant and a Fighter. The Savant has a Devil fruit, and the Fighter has an additional power to balance the crew to strengthen non-fruit users.
