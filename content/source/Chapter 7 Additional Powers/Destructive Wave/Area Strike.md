### Area Strike

When you gain this ability, you can replace a melee attack with a destructive wave, producing an area of effect in the shape you chose in the Area of Effect feature. Each creature within the chosen area succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take the damage they would take from the melee attack, taking half damage on a success.
For example, a greatsword would deal 2d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage to each creature that failed the saving throw. This also counts for anything that modifies the damage of the attack, such as Ardent Smites, certain creations, etc. (but not any additional effects like stunning strike)
The DC of the saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. You can unleash a destructive wave a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after finishing a short or long rest.
