### Song of Life and Death

Your inspiring words can call out to your allies in their time of need, saving them from certain doom, or enable them with the strength to destroy their foes. A creature with one of your Bardic Inspiration dice can expend it when dealing damage with a weapon attack, dealing an additional amount of damage equal to the die result added to the weapon’s damage. Additionally, when a living creature that has your Bardic Inspiration die is reduced to 0 hit points, it can expend that die as a reaction to be reduced to a number hit points equal to a roll of the Bardic Inspiration die instead.
