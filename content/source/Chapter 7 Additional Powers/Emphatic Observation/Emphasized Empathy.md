### Emphasized Empathy

You gain proficiency in Wisdom (Insight) skill checks. If you were already proficient in Insight, you instead gain expertise.
When you use Sense Presence, you also gain a sense of the emotions and true thoughts of those within your Sense Presence. You learn the creature's alignment and its immediate surface-level thoughts.
If you use the ability on them a second time, you can look deeper, you gain Insight into their reasoning, their emotional state, and their mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates).
A creature that is currently being deceitful can attempt to fool the observation haki by making a deception check against your insight.
