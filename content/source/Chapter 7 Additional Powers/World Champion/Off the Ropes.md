### Off the Ropes

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, when you use your Savage Slam feature while at least 10 feet off the ground, you deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same type as the attack for every 10 feet you are off the ground, up to a maximum of 10d6. If you hit with the attack, you also take no fall damage if you otherwise would.
