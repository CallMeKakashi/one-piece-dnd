### Thunderous Blows

At 10th level, you can unleash a flurry of thunderous blows. This feature replaces Thunderstruck. At the start of your, you can choose to imbue all your unarmed strikes with thunderous energy until the end of your turn. Your attacks with unarmed strikes are rolled with advantage, ignores half and three-quarters cover that is not haki imbued (shields included), and those attacks deal each an extra 1d8 thunder. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.
