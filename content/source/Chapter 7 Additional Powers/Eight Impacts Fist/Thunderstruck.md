### Thunderstruck

At 5th level, your thunderous blows improve. When you make an unarmed strike, you can choose to imbue it with thunder. You make the unarmed strike with advantage and it deals an additional 1d8 thunder damage. You can only use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining uses on a short or long rest.
