### Chosen Powers

When you gain this ability you learn one of the 3rd levels Six Powers from the Brawler subclass to learn. If the technique you have chosen require Spirit Points, and you don't have Spirit Points, you can use those techniques a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a short or long rest.
At 10th level, you learn another technique, and the one you had chosen previously improves to the 11th level version. At 15th level, the second power you chose improves.
