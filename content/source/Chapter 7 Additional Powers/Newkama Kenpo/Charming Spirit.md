### Charming Spirit

At 5th level, you can use your charm to fuel your spirit. You gain additional Spirit Points equal to their Charisma Modifier. These Spirit Points are added to any Spirit Point total and replenish after a short or long rest like with the rest of the Spirit Points.
In addition, you no longer have limited uses of the bonus action attack when you use your Swan Dance feature.
