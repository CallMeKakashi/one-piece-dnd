### Death Wink

At 5th level, you gain a new attack option which can be performed by winking. This attack can be used to replace any of your unarmed strikes, including a flurry of blows and the martial arts bonus action attack, and counts as an aesthetic weapon.
This special attack is a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is bludgeoning, and its damage die is a d6. This die changes as you gain brawler levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Brawler table.
Once per turn, the first creature you hit with this attack must make a Strength Saving throw against your Spirit DC. On a failure, they are either pushed back 10ft or knocked prone the user's choice.
