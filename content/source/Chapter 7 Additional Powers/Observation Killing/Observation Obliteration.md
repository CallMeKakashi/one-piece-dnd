### Observation Obliteration

When using your Overwhelming Presence, any creatures that remain conscious must make an additional Wisdom Saving Throw against your Conqueror's DC. On a failure, they lose all the benefits of their observation haki for 1 minute, repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns.
