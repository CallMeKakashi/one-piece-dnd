### Full Body Armor

On your turn, you can choose to expend an amount of Armament Points equal to your level to instead fully coat your body in a dark layer of armor.
For the next minute, you reduce all incoming damage by your level for 1 minute, and each saving throw you make during this time you can reroll once, taking the highest result.
This effect is ignored by attacks or creations that deal force or psychic damage.
