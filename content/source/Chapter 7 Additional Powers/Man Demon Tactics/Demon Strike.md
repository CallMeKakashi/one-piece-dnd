### Demon Strike

When you receive this power, you are able to harness both your strength and dexterity while wielding your weapons, causing them to rotate at a rapid pace. All melee weapons you wield gain the Finesse property. In addition, you add both your Strength and Dexterity modifiers to damage rolls made with any melee weapon you wield.
