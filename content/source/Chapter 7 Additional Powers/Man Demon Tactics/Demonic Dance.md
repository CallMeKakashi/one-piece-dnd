### Demonic Dance

At 5th level, your leaps through the air are not without purpose, slamming into the enemy with the extra momentum. When you use your Demon Leap feature, you can make an additional attack with a melee weapon you are wielding as part of the same bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.
