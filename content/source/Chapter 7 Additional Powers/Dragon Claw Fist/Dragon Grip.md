### Dragon Grip

At 5th level, your grip never leaves the enemy. After landing a successful strike on an enemy, you can attempt to grapple them with advantage. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a short or long rest.
In addition, while you are grappling a target, they start their turns taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage.
