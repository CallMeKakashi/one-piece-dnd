### Dragon Breath

At 10th level, you have trained yourself to strike the core of the ground to generate shockwaves. Once per turn, you can replace an unarmed strike to use the Thunderwave creation at 1st level using either your Strength or Dexterity to calculate the save DC.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.
