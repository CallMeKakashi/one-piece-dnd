### Universal Language

Starting at 1st level, you begin to hear the whispers. You have the innate ability to hear the "voice" of animals and inanimate objects, instinctually understanding the meaning behind the sounds and gestures of animals, or any imagery or written language upon an object, including poneglyphs. You gain no additional benefits to communicate back with beasts and objects through this feature, nor any ability to coerce them to communicate with you.
