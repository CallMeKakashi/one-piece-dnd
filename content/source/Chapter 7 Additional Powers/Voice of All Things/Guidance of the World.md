### Guidance of the World

Also at 5th level, you can ask the DM one question relegated to a specific object, place, or creature that you are trying to find. The DM then gives you one truthful answer that guides you in the direction of the thing you are looking for. You are not made aware of any dangers waiting on the path, nor does the answer you receive takes into account any changes that might as a result of an action taken by another player or NPC.
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until 7 days have passed since you last used it. At 10th level, your training with the voice allows you can use this feature once per long rest. At 15th level, once per short rest. At 20th level, you may use it as many times as you wish.
