### Rope Combatant

When you wield a 10ft length of rope as an improvised weapon, it gains the finesse and reach property, much like a whip, and deals your choice of 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can alternatively use a 10ft length of rope like a net.
If you are armed with a Strong Rope, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with it equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded up. When you use a Strong Rope like a net, the hit points and escape DC are the same as the Strong Rope.
