## Rope Action

*Prerequisite: Proficiency with improvised weapons*
The ability to tie knots is a very important skill to have in a world dominated by water, especially when it relates to the construction, repair, and operation of most traditional sailing ships. Combative prowess is a key skill, especially when traversing the Grandline. Rope Action is a fighting style that employs both knot tying and combat, allowing the user to restrain, strike, and defend against their enemies.
