### Raging Charge

When you move at least 10 ft. straight toward a target and then hit it with an Attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d8 damage from the melee weapon used. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 ft. away and knocked prone. The DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.
You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.
