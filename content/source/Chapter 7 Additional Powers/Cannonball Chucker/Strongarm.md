### Strongarm

Once per turn, while wielding a cannonball, you may use it as an improvised weapon attack. This attack uses the statistics of a Cannon Attack with a Swivel Gun, using either your Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls (using the same madifier for both). This attack counts as having the thrown property.
At 10th level, you can instead treat this attack as one used with a 12-Pounder instead of a Swivel Gun.
