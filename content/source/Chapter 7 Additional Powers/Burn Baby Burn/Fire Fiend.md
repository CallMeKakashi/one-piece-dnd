### Fire Fiend

At 10th level, your flames burn away at the weak parts of your enemies. When you hit a creature that is currently ignited, by your Fuel the Fire feature, you gain a 1d6 bonus to your attack rolls against that burning target.
In addition, you can expend a charge of Hellfire Halitosis to conjure a bout of flames to hunt down your enemies. You use the Conjure Elemental Creation, summoning a Conjured Elemental of the Fire type, using your Constitution modifier as the creativity modifier.
