### Release The Beast

At 20th level, you can burn away the last vestiges of your weaknesses, for one last moment of triumph. Once a long rest when you drop to zero hit points, you can enter Beast Mode for 1 minute. You immediately regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum and gain the following benefits for the duration of Beast Mode:
* You gain 66 temporary hit points.
* You exude a 20ft radius aura of fear. Each creature of your choice within this aura and aware of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Fuel the Fire DC, or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
* Once on each of your turns, when you attack with a weapon attack using the Attack action, you can make one additional attack as part of the same action.
* When you hit a creature under the effects of your Fuel the Fire feature, your attacks deal an additional 10 fire damage against it.
* When you deal fire damage against a creature that is immune to fire damage, you can treat the immunity as resistance instead.
* You can use your Numbed Nerves feature without expending any of its uses.
* You can use the Vengeful Flames creation at will at first level.
