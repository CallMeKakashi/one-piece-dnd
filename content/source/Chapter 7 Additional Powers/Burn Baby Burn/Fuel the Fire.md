### Fuel the Fire

Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or flammable object, you can, once per turn, choose to ignite it. If the target is a creature, they must make a Constitution saving throw, DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a success, they do not catch on fire. On a failure, the target is set ablaze. While the target is on fire, they take 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of their turns. If the target is a creature, they can attempt to put out the fire by stopping, dropping, and rolling. They can expend all their movement on their turn to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your Fuel the Fire DC, ending the effect on a success.
You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier, regaining all uses of this ability at the end of a short or long rest. In addition, when you deal fire damage, you ignore resistance to fire damage.
