### Numbed Nerves

Time and time again you’ve been burned, numbing you to the pain, lighting the hellfire inside you. You gain resistance to fire damage.
In addition, as a reaction to taking fire damage, you can choose to turn the pain from the flames into power. Instead of taking the fire damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the fire damage from the triggering source, not counting your resistance. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier, regaining all uses at the end of a short or long rest.
