### Hellfire Halitosis

Starting at 5th level, you can unleash waves of fire to engulf your enemies. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a gout of flames in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Fuel the Fire DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save. The damage of this ability increased to 8d6 at 11th level, and 11d6 at 17th level. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.
