### A Lesson in Trickery

You gain a number of Cheat Dice equal to your proficiency bonus, all of which you regain at the end of a short or long rest. These Cheat Dice are d8s
* **By the Skin of My Teeth.** As a reaction to a creature hitting you with an attack, you can expend one of your Cheat Dice to roll it to reduce the attack roll by the result. If the attack is a critical hit, it instead becomes a normal hit.
* **Run and Flee.** You cause you opponent to momentarily drop their guard long enough for you to flee. As a bonus action, you can expend one of your Cheat Dice to move a number of feet equal to 5 x the number rolled on your Cheat Dice. During this movement, you do not provoke opportunity attacks.
* **Just as Planned.** If you fail an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can expend a Cheat Die to roll it and add the result to the roll, potentially changing it to a success. If this feature is used on a critical failure, it instead turns into a normal failure.
