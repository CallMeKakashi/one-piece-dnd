## Dreams

Everyone has dreams, whether they are humble and simple or grand and ambitious. A character's dream should be unique to them and act as the ultimate end goal for their story.
A dream can be a simple desire to possess something, or a more diffuse ideal that a character is chasing. Whatever it may be, it goes beyond a simple ambition or goal; a dream is something that defines a character as a person, something they are willing to risk their life or even die for.
Each role has a few suggested dreams appropriate to the role, however, work with your DM to determine exactly what motivates your character to seek adventure on the open seas of the world of _One Piece_.
