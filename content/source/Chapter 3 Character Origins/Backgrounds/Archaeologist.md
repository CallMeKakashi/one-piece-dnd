### Archaeologist

An archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains-their bones, ruins, surviving masterworks, and tombs. Those who practice archaeology travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars, and cataclysms.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain the treasures and relics of wizards, warlords, or royalty. Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world's greatest treasures from falling into the wrong hands. Whatever their motivations, archaeologists combine the qualities of a scrappy historian with the self-made heroism of a treasure-hunting scoundrel.

> ##### Offical 5e Backgrounds
> While this system can work with regular 5e backgrounds, most of the backgrounds featured in this book grant extra abilities (most of which grant or are akin to feats).
>
> Due to this reason, using official 5e backgrounds may need some tweaking to fit more within the setting, however, that is ultimately up to your Dungeon Master.
