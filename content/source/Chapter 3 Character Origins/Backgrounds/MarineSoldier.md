### Marine/Soldier

War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, and learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
Or more likely, you were once part of the Navy under the World Government, sailing the seas to combat the oncoming scourge of pirates, serving under one of the three great powers of the world.
