Tool Proficiencies: Cartographer's Tools or Navigator's Tools, Water Vehicles
Equipment: A map of the surrounding area within 100 nautical miles; Rations x10; Cartographers or Navigator's tools
#### Feature: Keen Eye

#### Suggested Characteristics
Navigators can be a rough lot, as do many people at sea, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.
