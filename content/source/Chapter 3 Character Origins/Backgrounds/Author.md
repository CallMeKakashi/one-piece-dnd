### Author

Most of the world's history and culture are inked into the pages of tomes that lie in the dusty halls of libraries and live in the studies of great wizards. Those who write these tomes can influence the way people think and feel, how events are remembered, and how the future may be looked out. You are one of these people, a writer.
Few people look at a writer as one who goes out of their way to find knowledge, many, imagine a writer to stay at their desk and merely write until their dying breath. This raises the question: How do the authors who write of the natures of beasts and fey learn of these things? Simple, they go out into the world themselves. They say a writer’s greatest tool is his ink and quill, but clearly, a sword and spell can help pull a book together just as well.
