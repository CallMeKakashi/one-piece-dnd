### Revolutionary

You are or were a rebel, a person who wants to destroy the government you are currently or were once in. You probably started in the early protests when most thought little of your revolutionary group or joined later on in the height of the revolution. Either way, you quickly learned battle, survival, and leadership skills in the riots and battles of your unstable homeland.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Surviving through a revolution, regardless of a person's side, can lead them to a politically extreme road. Revolutionists often debate and protest even after a successful takeover of a government. Revolutionists also prove to often be unorthodox, often participating in strange forms of celebratory and arts to protest the norms of the past government and society. However, revolutionists also learn how to work in a team, and often are willing to help their allies even if it could potentially harm their livelihood. Unfortunately, revolutionists are also extreme on rivals, and often revolutionists pick more rivals than allies.
