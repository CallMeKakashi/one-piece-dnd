### Bounty Hunter

There are many groups and organizations out there in the blues. Most of them are pirates or marines, but there are a few who walk a fine line between the two. Often mistaken for simple travelers, Bounty Hunters make their living hunting down those who have built up a bad reputation, their main motivation is to hunt down that sweet bounty of berries.
Whether the reason is survival or principle, bounty hunters are often considered a neutral party in the world, being a hired hand and all, they can work for the most righteous of marines, or the most heinous of criminals, and all who lay in between.

#### Suggested Characteristics
A bounty hunter's sole purpose is to hunt down people with a price on their heads, for grievances ranging from the mundane to the terrible. Those who follow this life can be quiet, taciturn individuals as readily as they can be savage brutes living not for the pay, but for the thrill of pursuit. Hunters are therefore often as varied in personality as their marks.
##### Personality Traits
| d8 | Personality Trait |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | I tend to approach conversations with people I've just met as though it were an interrogation. |
| 2 | I'll accept the help of others with a bounty, so long as they can prove their skill to me first. |
| 3 | I project arrogance and conceit at times, especially after turning in a troublesome target. |
| 4 | I'm not prone to idle chatter and prefer keeping to myself unless the topic's business. |
| 5 | It needn't be hunting down a mark - I'll chop firewood for an old woman if there's pay involved. |
| 6 | I have a great deal of practical experience from hunting bounties and can relate to almost any situation. |
| 7 | I frequently move from town to town, eager to pursue new marks and seek new contacts. |
| 8 | I'm rather adept at games of skill like darts, or five-finger fillet. |
##### Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | **Justice.** These people have violated the law once. I won't let it happen twice. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Clean-up.** I will get these criminals off the street with help from the law or not. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | **Brutality.** Gold pales to the brilliance of the life draining from their eyes. (Evil) |
| 4 | **Morality.** It's not enough to hunt them down. They have to understand what they've done is reprehensible. (Good) |
| 5 | **Ambiguity.** This job's just a job, like any other. Nothing personal against my targets. (Neutral) |
| 6 | **Endurance.** In no other line of work could anyone expect to test their limits so completely. (Any) |
##### Bonds
| d6 | Bond |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | Once a soldier, my comrade's grave betrayal forced me from my home, and into this life. |
| 2 | Though my friends are few, I owe them my life many times over, and would happily die for them. |
| 3 | Horrendous tales and vile rumors destroyed my family's good name, and this path is the only recourse to finding the truth. |
| 4 | The contract turned sour, and now I find myself yoked to dangerously twisted employers. |
| 5 | All my deeds would surely consign me to prison - only by servicing officials do I stay free. |
| 6 | Mindless thuggery stole the life of one I cherished, and the price they must pay is one I will collect. |
##### Flaws
| d6 | Flaw |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | Not only am I good at what I do, but I love what I do - and I hate myself for it. |
| 2 | Sleep, when it comes, is no sleep at all. The time spent tracking marks has left me skittish and paranoid. |
| 3 | I refuse to believe anyone can be trusted and will root through their life until I'm satisfied they can be. |
| 4 | At a younger age my actions earned me the brand of a criminal, and those mistakes haunt me and my fellows even today. |
| 5 | Contract or not, I never bring murder bounties back alive. They showed no mercy, and so neither will I. |
| 6 | It is only for my own selfish need to be the best at what I do that I abandon my team to bring the bounty in first. |
