### Mercenary

As a mercenary, your services were for hire to anyone who could afford them. What drove you to be a soldier of fortune? Was it to escape poverty? Was it the thrill of battle? Or was it simply that fighting was all you knew growing up? Who was your mercenary company, or did you work alone? What made you give it up, or are you still for hire? Did you make any allies or enemies along the way? What wars or battles were involved in? What were the consequences? Lost allies? War crime charges?
