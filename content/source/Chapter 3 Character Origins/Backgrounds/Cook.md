### Cook

You once were a chef, the king of food. Either you were an artisan chef with a fine sense of taste, a master chef who knows dozens on dozens of recipes by heart, or a cook at the mess hall, serving food quickly and on the double.
You understand that food has a voice; it can express moods with the right combinations of ingredients, or bring people together with a peaceful meal.
What brought you out of the kitchen and into the sea? A rare ingredient? Maybe your upper chef decided it was time for you to go? Or, maybe, you wanted to go on an adventure to discover the mythical All Blue?
Regardless of why you decided to change pace from your culinary solitude, your cooking and food-handling skills will prove vital to your crew.
