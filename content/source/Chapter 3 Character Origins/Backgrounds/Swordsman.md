### Swordsman

For years, you have studied the blade. Where most simply wield a sword in combat, you wield your blade as an artist, ready to make your mark on the world, using a blade rather than a brush. You rarely stay in the same place, constantly looking to sharpen your skills, often finding or causing trouble wherever you end up. Some say you're lost, but you know your truth, your goals. You are a swordsman.
Skill Proficiencies: 2 from Athletics, Acrobatics, History, Perception
Weapon Proficiencies: 2 simple or martial melee weapons of your choice that deal piercing or slashing damage.
Equipment: 150,000 Berries; Small Medkits x3; Rations x5, a whetstone, and a memento from a person from your past.
#### Feature: Blade Mastery
As each swordsman is unique, so is their blade. You gain your choice of a weapon mastery feat with a simple or martial melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage.
#### Suggested Characteristics
Swordsmen carry their honor on their backs, and their hopes and dreams at their side. Typically, they wander, perhaps following along with a group of people to further their goals. Rarely does a swordsman swear loyalty to a person or organization, but when they do, said loyalty is everlasting, unbreakable.
