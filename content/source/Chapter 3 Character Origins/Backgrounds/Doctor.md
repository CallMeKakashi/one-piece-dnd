### Doctor

As the world is full of deadly diseases, there are doctors ready to combat such ailments. These doctors are better known for their additional social aspect of communicating with patients as well as often treating their ailments through an accessible and nonmagical procedure.
Doctors also perform invasive procedures to save lives, like conducting surgeries or helping induce birth. For the most part, doctors are expected to be paragons of good. They are beholden to a code that ensures they do no harm and try their very best to help patients. As such, it should come as no surprise that they often encounter the worst in humanity.
Moral issues tail them around as purveyors of limited good. Temptations can lead a doctor astray and easily make them into a monster.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Doctors come from many walks of life. Some may be well educated while others may have learned how to be a doctor through the passing down of knowledge from one generation to another, while others may have had to start from scratch and have had to learn as they doctored. Regardless, many doctors are troubled by the harrowing events they bore witness to. Some are shockingly pragmatic, with an "it may not be pretty, but you'll live" approach to problems. Many are seemingly tireless, hard-working individuals. Some can be inspiring souls, with a deep appreciation, not only for life but for the person who is alive as well.
