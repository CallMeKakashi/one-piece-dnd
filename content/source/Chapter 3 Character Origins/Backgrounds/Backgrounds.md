## Backgrounds

Every story, in the world of _One Piece_, has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, your past life before setting out to sea, and your place in the world.
Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or grizzled soldier. Your gadgeteer could have been a humble scientist or a curious noble. Your rogue might have gotten by as a common thief or commanded audiences as a court jester.
