### Blacksmith

As long as there are battles to be fought, you will no doubt find a blacksmith not too far. An expert at shaping steel, or any material into a refined, deadly weapon.
Blacksmiths have dedicated most of their lives to their craft, allowing them not only to create basic weapons and armor but weapons and armor that bear wills of their own that aim to strengthen or damper their wielder.
As a blacksmith, there are many ways your career began. You could have been an apprentice for a master blacksmith hailing from Wano, or even a self-taught master of working metal.
Skill Proficiencies: 2 from Sleight of Hand, History, Athletics, and Insight
Tool Proficiencies: Smiths Tools

#### Feature: Mastercrafter
You gain the ability to improve any one weapon or armor using your advanced blacksmithing knowledge. You gain your choice of one of the following abilities:
* At the end of a long rest, you can touch one object which is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you use this feature on another object, the object becomes a mastercraft item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon. If the item has a +1-3 bonus already on it, you add your +1 bonus on top of it (to a maximum of +3). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
* You gain the [Master Smith Feat (Pg. 219)](#p219).
