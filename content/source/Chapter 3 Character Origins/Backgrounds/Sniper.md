#### Suggested Characteristics
Snipers are an observant bunch, few things get past them. Snipers often assume the worst, and thus are always prepared for things to go south. While not all are resigned to fighting, snipers make it their mission to take out threats before they strike, as they don’t want themselves, or their allies to be caught by surprise.
