### Scholar

Scholars are purveyors of knowledge and intrepid explorers of the forgotten past. While many are content staying in the safe confines of libraries and academies, others feel a longing call to adventure in their hearts and set sail for the Grand Line.
Scholars that board pirate ships typically do so because they're pursuing knowledge that the world government does not want them to find: The secrets of the mythical Void Century and the knowledge of how to read ancient poneglyphs found scattered around the world.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, choose one from Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, or Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, Forgery kit
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a leatherbound journal, inkwell, quill, and a pouch containing 100 000 beri
#### Feature: Pursuer of Secrets
You can read and write in poneglyphs. Scholars are close to the only people in the world that can do this, and are actively being hunted by the world government as a result. When you attempt to recall common information about an area you know the true name of, you automatically succeed any check to do so.
Additionally, you are well-versed in the lore of the world. If you do not know a specific piece of information when you try to recall it, you instead know where you can learn this information if it can be found in places such as libraries, scribes, or held secret by known sages. Your DM might rule that certain information is near or completely inaccessible, or that it can only be found in one specific place that is extraordinarily difficult to reach.
#### Feature: Bonus Feat
You gain a bonus feat of your choice. Below are some potential options:
* [Historian (Pg. 214)](#p214)
* [Investigator (Pg. 214)](#p214)
* [Keen Mind (Pg. 214)](#p214)
