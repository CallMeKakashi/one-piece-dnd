### Shipwright

Sailing the Grand Line without a ship built by a skilled shipwright is to invite disaster and flirt with death. The waters of the Grand Line are as dangerous as the beasts that dwell beneath the surface, and only a monster of a ship could hope to conquer those waves.
Shipwrights are responsible for not only building but also maintaining, the vessel upon which the crew sails from island to island. It is an art form that cannot be shorthanded, for shipwrights know that if their flagship does not hold water, their entire crew will go down with it.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Engineering, choose one from Athletics, History, Investigation, Perception, or Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Carpenter's tools, 2 artisan's tool sets of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a scroll case full of blueprints, carpenter's tools, and a pouch containing 50 000 beri.
#### Feature: Craft Vessel
As a shipwright, naturally you know how to draw out the blueprints for and build a ship. Given the necessary materials, such as wood, steel, and cloth, you can construct ships from scratch with enough time and the right tools at hand. Additionally, you can repair a ship that has a reduced hit point maximum, and when you repair a ship it regains twice as many hit points as it normally would (See *building, maintaining and repairing your ship* in Chapter 4).
Additionally, the time and cost it takes to craft items made from wood and metal is cut in half due to your expertise in working with both materials.
#### Feature: Bonus Feat
You gain a bonus feat of your choice. Below are some potential options:
* [Adept Modifier (Pg. 207)](#p207)
* [Battle Creator (Pg. 207)](#p207)
* [Brawny (Pg. 208)](#p208)
* [Creativity Adept (Pg. 209)](#p209)
* [Engineer (Pg. 211)](#p211)
* [Free Diver (Pg. 212)](#p212)
