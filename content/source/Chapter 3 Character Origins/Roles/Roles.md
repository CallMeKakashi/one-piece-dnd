## Roles

A ship cannot brave the open sea and much less the Grand Line if it does not have a crew of diverse skills and abilities to maintain it. A character's role on the ship is as, if not even more important than their class.
By assembling a crew of different roles, a captain can bring a ship on grand adventures without worrying about the little details on the way. Each role fills a necessary role to survive the Grand Line, but the most important roles to cover are captain, navigator, doctor, and shipwright. If the end goal is to find One Piece, a scholar will be required as well.
