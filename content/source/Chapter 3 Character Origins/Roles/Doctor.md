### Doctor

At the end of the day, a pirate's life is a rough life filled with danger and hazards. Most crews cannot make it far without a doctor on deck for good reasons. A doctor's duties speak for themselves, as they're tasked with looking after their crewmates' health. A good deal of patience and kindness is oftentimes required for such a role, as pirates tend to be chaotic and free-spirited to the point of recklessness.
Looking after people hellbent on putting themselves in danger can be a trying task, which is why any crew that has a good doctor tends to count themselves as lucky.
