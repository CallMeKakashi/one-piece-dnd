### Deckhand

A deckhand's role is much less defined than some of the others, however when push comes to shove they can prove to be the most valuable member of a crew.
Deckhands are jack-of-all-trades that adds a great deal of versatility and utility to the crew by helping out with other roles. While they rarely excel in any particular area, they know a little bit about everything which makes them invaluable to any crewmember that needs a helping hand every so often.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Deception, Engineering, Investigation, Perception, or Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One artisan's tool kit of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a hammer, a spyglass, and a pouch containing 50 000 beri
#### Feature: All Hands on Deck
While you do not specialize in any particular role, specialize in performing menial tasks aboard the ship such as taking inventory, swabbing the deck, manning the cannons, or acting lookout in the crow's nest.
You can always find your way around any ship you board and can move across the deck without having to make ability checks to figure out where specific rooms are.
Additionally, filling in on so many different roles makes it easy for you to lend aid to your fellow crewmembers. When you assist a creature that is engaged in the crafting process, you halve the time and cost it takes to craft that item.
#### Feature: Bonus Feat
You gain a bonus feat of your choice. Below are some potential options:
* [Creativity Adept (Pg. 209)](#p209)
* [Fighting Initiate (Pg. 212)](#p212)
* [Mobile (Pg. 220)](#p220)
* [Beary Blue (Pg. 220)](#p220)
* [Perceptive (Pg. 220)](#p220)
* [Underdog (Pg. 226)](#p226)
#### Dream
A deckhand's dreams tend to be a lot more humble than those of other roles. Their dreams tend to be more personal, relating to themselves or their crew. Choose a dream from the table below or create your own with the help of your DM.
