### Captain

Perhaps the most important role to fill on a ship is the captain. As a captain, you set the course of the ship you're sailing and spearhead your crew into the adventure ahead.
Your most valuable power isn't your strength in combat, though it's typically above average, but rather your ability to inspire and lead others. As a captain, the lives of your entire crew rest upon your shoulders, and your duty towards them comes second to none.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Persuasion choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One set of tools of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a pirate flag featuring your jolly roger, a spyglass, and a pouch containing 100 000 beri
#### Feature: Force of Personality
You have an unmistakable presence that is felt by all those around you.
People and creatures that you meet with are more likely to be amenable and forthcoming, even if they don't understand why, the common folk are more willing to lend you their ear and even aid as long as you do not show yourself openly hostile to them. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, the check cannot have disadvantage, nor be reduced in any way.
Lastly, you have the potential to unlock the mythical power of Conqueror's Haki and can be awarded Conqueror's Haki when you reach certain character levels.
#### Feature: Bonus Feat
You gain a bonus feat of your choice. Below are some potential options:
* [Alert (Pg. 207](#p207)
* [Brave (Pg. 208)](#p208)
* [Brawny (Pg. 208)](#p208)
* [Inspiring Leader (Pg. 214)](#p214)
* [Joyful (Pg. 221)](#p221)
* [Tough (Pg. 226)](#p226)
#### Dream
A captain's dream is extremely important for the crew, as it is what shapes the journey they are undertaking. Choose a dream from the table below or create your own with the help of your DM.
