### Navigator

After the captain, the navigator might be the most important role to fill on a ship. While the captain decides where to take the ship, the navigator's task is to figure out how to get there.
Being a navigator requires a level head and a quick wit, as understanding sea charts and weather conditions is entirely imperative to set the course of a ship. The most skilled navigators can tell what the weather will be like just from a breeze in the wind or a drop of a few degrees in temperature.
Without a knowledgeable navigator on board, most ships would be happy to find another harbor after setting sail, less so the one they were looking for.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Survival, choose one from Athletics, History, Religion, Perception, or Nature
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Cartographer's tools, Navigator's tools
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, cartographer's tools, navigator's tools, 5 blank sea charts, inkwell, quill, and a pouch containing 50 000 beri
#### Feature: Weather Portent
As a navigator, you have an almost supernatural ability to read the weather and the sea, sometimes predicting what it will be like with uncanny accuracy.
You can always tell what the weather will be like within the next hour and always know which way is north as long as you can see the sky. Additionally, you and your crew cannot get lost as long as you have the stars or the sun to guide you.
Additionally, your expertise in charting unknown waters makes you able to tell a real map or sea chart from a fake one at a glance. You also don't need to make a Navigator's tools check when sailing under normal sailing conditions.
