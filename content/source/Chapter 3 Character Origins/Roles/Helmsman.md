### Helmsman

The helmsman of a ship is the one responsible for steering it through the storm. While the navigator charts the course and the shipwright keeps the vessel in good shape, the helmsman is the one braving the ocean waves from behind the wheel.
Helmsmen are steadfast and typically possess great physical strength. They are tasked with keeping the ship steady through the storm and safely guiding it through the sharp reefs. While anyone can attempt to steer a ship, only with a skilled helmsman can it reach its full potential.

#### Ocean Tamer
You have manned many ships in your time and have learned how to instantly recognize the strengths and weaknesses of a vessel. When you commandeer a ship from the helm, you instantly learn all of the ship's statistics, including its current and maximum hit points, and whether its current hit point maximum has been reduced or not.
Additionally, be it your might or intuition, you can use any Ability Score for any check made to steer and control any ship you choose helm.
Furthermore, you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed if you don't already have one.
