### Musician

A role that is often understated and sometimes flat-out forgotten about is that of the musician. While some people would insist such a role is superfluous, any pirate worth their salt knows you can't sail the open seas without laughter and music to blaze your trail.
Musicians keep their crew happy with performance, song, and dance. They lift the tired spirits and weary bodies of their crewmates after gruesome fights or violent storms, revivifying them with joy and hope to carry on with their journey through any hardships they may face.

#### Entertainer's Routine
Your musical talent lends itself well to currying favor. You can always find a place to perform in towns and settlements, such as taverns, and you and your crew can stay for free in such establishments as long as you perform there every night.
Additionally, at the start of each day, you can engage in an inspiring performance to motivate one of your allies. At the start of each dawn, select a single, friendly creature that can see and hear you. That creature gains a temporary point of Inspiration that lasts until the end of the day, or until it is used by the selected creature.
