### Cook

The cook of the ship is tasked with providing good food and drink to the crew, as well as looking after their pantry and making sure what food they have will last them from island to island.
While anyone can throw together a basic meal, only a cook can create the kind of food that makes a pirate's heart sing with courage and vigor. They keep their crewmates content and happy with their food, allowing them to focus their effort on their own matters instead.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from History, Nature, Persuasion, Performance, Sleight of Hand, or Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Cook's Utensils
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, cook's utensils, a knife kit consisting of 3 chef knives that can be used as daggers, and a pouch containing 50 000 beri
#### Feature: Kitchen Artisan
As a trained cook, you've learned to use every last bit and a scrap of raw ingredients to create a filling and satisfying meal. While on a ship, you and your crew require only half as many rations and half as much water as you normally would gain enough nourishment for a day.
Additionally, your expertise in cooking grants you the ability to make the most efficently tasty and healthy foods for you and your allies. The time and cost it takes to craft food items is cut in half.
Additionally, you can learn "attack cuisine" recipes, a secret form of cuisine taught in the Kamabakka kingdom. Secrets of it occasionally drift onto the sea, but only those dedicated to culinary arts can hope to master this cuisine.
