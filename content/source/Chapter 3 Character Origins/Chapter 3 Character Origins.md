# Chapter 3: Character Origins

Characters in the world of _One Piece_ are not defined by their origins or past, but by their dreams and aspirations. It doesn't matter if a character is born among the privileged nobility, as the son of a great pirate, or as the heir to a marine hero if their dream draws them towards a horizon away from where their blood would suggest they search for it.
When creating a character, consider what role on a ship you imagine they would fill, and what they have done up to this point working towards that goal. Also, consider what they are working towards; what ambition drives them out to sea? What dreams do they have that won't be fulfilled by staying put in their hometown? How do they interact when faced with the dreams of others, whether those align or clash with their own ideals?
