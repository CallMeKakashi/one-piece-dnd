## Choosing a Race

While humans are the most common by a long shot to be found in the world, they still live side-by-side with other races even if they aren't always aware of it. Even then, human tribes are so diverse that distinctions between them are more than simply cultural. Whatever choice you make, your character remains a part of the living, breathing world.
The call to adventure can ring true in the heart of any creature in the world, however some races produce more adventurers than others. Humans and fishmen are more likely to go to sea as pirates in search of dreams, treasure, or ambition but your choice of race should not be hindered by conventions. Minks and merfolk are curious by nature, and sky islanders are not faint of heart either, so even if they typically do not fly a jolly roger nothing is stopping them from doing so.
