### History of Conflict

Among the one hundred and seventy kingdoms that make up the world government, all but one is a human kingdom giving the human race an indiscriminate claim to being the dominant race in the world. Adding to that, they are also the most technologically advanced and organized race, giving them a massive geopolitical edge in the state of the world.
However, human history is one of strife and conflict, both amongst themselves and against other races. Their society is heavily fractured by deep-seated socioeconomic inequalities; the world nobles can make any demands with the world government's full support, while countries that cannot pay taxes are left at the mercy of pirates and marauders. While life on the sea is a harsh one, it is at the very least an equal existence for all who travel upon it.
