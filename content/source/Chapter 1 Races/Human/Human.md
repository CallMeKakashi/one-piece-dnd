## Human

By far the most numerous of all races are humans. Inhabiting the entire world from the hundred and seventy kingdoms to the halls of Marie Geoise upon the Red Line, the humans have spread all across the four seas to stake claim to the title of masters of the world.
Few humans are defined by their race, however. A varied kind from every echelon of society, one would find it difficult to place a blanket term on humans as a whole. They can be fearless heroes, intrepid adventurers, craven villains, despicable tyrants, pirates seeking freedom, or marine soldiers seeking order. The only surefire way to know where a human's heart lies is to look at the flag she flies, which can be as manifold as the stars upon the night sky.
