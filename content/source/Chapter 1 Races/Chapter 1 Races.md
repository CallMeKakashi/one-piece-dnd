# Chapter 1: Races

The world of _One Piece_ is home to a myriad of unique humanoid races that make their home on the four seas and beyond. Life thrives from the bottom of the ocean beneath the Red Line to far above the clouds in the flying lands of Skypiea, each housing a civilization with a rich history and uncertain futures.
With a world consisting of scattered islands dotting an endless ocean, it is no strange occurrence that many are drawn to a life of adventure, setting sail into the horizon as pirates and freedom-seekers. Though very different in shape and story, one thing all races of the world have in common is the call to adventure that rings within the hearts of the select few, regardless of their origins.
Walking the streets of a port town in the Grand Line, one could sometimes find more than humans in the crowd if one just knows where to look for them. The blue-tinted skin of a stout fishman as he hauls a massive chest of goods to the market. Skulking in the shadows, a cat mink curiously explores the alleys and corners of this strange world, vigilant and ready for any threat. The sharp, intimidating tattoos of a shandian sky islander cast wary glances at the crowd around him, but many choose not to say anyhting due to the arsenal of dial-based weaponry on his person.
Performing in the town square is a band of entertainers, all part of the long-arm tribe, using their elongated limbs to perform acts of acrobatics and dexterity to the cheer of a crowd. A group of long-leg humans pushes their way to the front of the crowd, already towering over it, intent on starting some trouble. And in the harbor, a curious mermaid peeks her head above the water for but a moment, starry eyes gazing upon the moored ships and colorful flags, before she dives back beneath the waves before anyone spots her.
