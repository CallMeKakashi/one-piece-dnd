***Integrated Armor.*** Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, which can be done as part of a rest. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.
***Integrated Toolbox.*** You can integrate a weapon, item, or a set of tools into you with 10 minutes of uninterrupted work, which can be done as part of any rest. Once integrated, you can draw or stow the item as part of any action that involves its use, and you cannot be disarmed of it against your will. You can integrate a number of items equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.
#### Chimera
Your body has been augmented with the features of a wild beast, granting you enhanced strength and senses.
***Beast Body.*** You gain a movement speed based on the animal that you embody. You have either a flying speed of 30 feet, a swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe underwater, or a climbing speed of 30 feet and a burrow speed of 10 feet which when you select this race.
***Darkvision.*** Your bestial side enhances your sense. You have darkvision out to 60 feet and can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

You can use these natural weapons to make unarmed strikes, and they deal 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage on hit. You can choose whether to use Strength or Dexterity when attacking with these natural weapons, but must use the same ability score for both the attack and damage roll.
> ##### Note for Players: Flying Races
> It is important to consider that some DMs may not allow players to choose any flying races, and a Chimera with a fly speed is one of those examples. The reason for this is when flying gets combined with range combat, especially in early levels when few enemies themselves may fly or have ranged attacks.

***Natural Armor.*** Your skin alone is tough enough to block sword and bullets. While you're not wearing armor, your armor class is calculated as 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC.
***Spark of War.*** When you deal damage to a target, you may choose to deal extra acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder, radiant, or necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus. You choose which type when you create your character.
You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
