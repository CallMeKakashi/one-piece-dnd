### Made to Order

Most augmented were created for a singular purpose, such as the pacifistas created by the world government or the zombies raised by Dr. Hogback. Most augmented were normal people at first, and many had no say in their transformation into augmented. Unscrupulous scientists have no qualms about using slaves or kidnapped civilians for their experiments. True freedom is a luxury that many augmented have never tasted in their life.
