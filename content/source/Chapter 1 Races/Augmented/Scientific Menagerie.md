### Scientific Menagerie

The existence of augmented humanoids is a very recent thing, appearing as the result of scientific progress. Doctors, scientists and madmen alike have always sought to overcome the limits of the human body, and to this end they created the augmented from already living, or sometimes even dead, creatures. Augmented vary greatly in appearance, however they can typically be categorized into groups depending on how they were experimented on. If an augmented had body parts replaced with machinery, they are considered a cyborg; if an augmented had body parts replaced with those of wild animals, they are considered a chimera; if the augmented was given no visual modifications and instead only returned to life from a dead state, they are considered a revived; and finally, if an augmented were only given internal or genetical modifications with no visible changes, they are considered to be an artificial human.
