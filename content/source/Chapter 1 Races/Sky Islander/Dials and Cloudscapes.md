### Dials and Cloudscapes

Daily life on the sky islands revolve around the use of dials, a type of shell left by a species of shellfish unique to the sky islands. These dials have the unique ability to store different forms of energy and matter, such as the breath dial which can store air currents, or the flame dial which can store open, living fire. As long as the shell is intact, a dial can be recharged indefinitely as long as it is subjected to the energy or matter that it can store, as each dial can only handle one specific element.
Dials are more than simple tools to sky islanders. With the lack of naturally occurring earth in their world, their entire society has been shaped around the use of dials. It is used to power what is known as "wavers", unique dial-driven vehicles that can easily traverse the cloud sky; as weapons used by fighters and warriors to produce force, fire or even cutting winds; to shape clouds like wood and stone to make foundations for buildings and roads; and as simple household items such as heat dials to cook, or light dials to illuminate rooms.
