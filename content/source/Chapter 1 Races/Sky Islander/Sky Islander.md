## Sky Islander

Far removed from the seas of blue and shores of sand lies a collection of islands resting in the balmy embrace of the clouds above, known to all as the mythical sky islands. Here, the "water" is white and made of strange, buoyant clouds that flow just like seawater, while the "earth" is made from springy, firm yet soft clouds that can support entire cities and forests.
To most residents of the "blue" sea, as the world below the clouds is known to the inhabitants of sky islands, the idea of there existing a world above in the clouds is one of fantasy and myth. Anyone who would claim otherwise is often met with ridicule and possibly even scorn, for the idea of another sea existing above them is ludicrous to most humans.
Yet anything a man can imagine is a possible reality. Hailing from these mythical islands are a tribe of humanoids known collectively as sky islanders, though they rarely refer to themselves as such. Atop the clouds lies an endless stretch of islands, kingdoms, and tribes with their unique history. The largest known society is that of Skypiea, situated ten thousand meters above the waters of Paradise in the Grand Line. Home to the skypieans and shandia, distinguishable by the small wings upon their back, it is the largest settlement found upon the clouds of the world. Only reachable through one of two ways, the long and arduous "High West" or the extremely dangerous "Geyser Stream", it is a land that sees few visitors.
