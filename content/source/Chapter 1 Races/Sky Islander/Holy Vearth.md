### Holy Vearth

Earth does not appear naturally on sky islands. Though plants can grow on the clouds they shape, they cannot germinate through them like they can in earth. As a result, sky islanders consider earth to be the most precious substance of all and has exalted it to holy status, referring to it as "vearth".
The largest mass of earth can be found in Skypiea, known as Upper Yard among the locals. For the longest time since it arrived on the sky island 400 years ago, it was the seat of the Skypiean political and religious leader known as "god".
