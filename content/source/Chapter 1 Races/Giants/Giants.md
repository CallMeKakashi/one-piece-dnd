## Giants

Found mainly in the Grand Line, the might of the giants has been observed and feared for centuries. While most giants hail from Elbaf, that is not the only place where giants hail from, like most humanoid creatures. There are also many kinds of giants out in the world, from pureblood giants to ancient giants, to even halfbreeds from the sea.
