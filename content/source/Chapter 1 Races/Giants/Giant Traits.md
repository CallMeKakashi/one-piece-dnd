### Giant Traits

As a giant, you have the following traits.
***Ability Score Increase.*** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another one increases by 2. Alternatively, four ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Typically these would be strength or consitution.
***Age.*** Giants live about three times longer than the average human, about 300 years, sometimes even longer. They also reach maturity around the same time as regular humans.
***Alignment.*** Unstoppable warrior giants are almost always chaotic neutral, while those not born in battle usually gravitate towards lawful alignments.
***Size.*** Giants are much larger than any normal 5e scale. Your size is Gargantuan at the very least. Most giants are over 20 meters tall, or about 65 feet tall.
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Due to your size.
***Subraces.*** Choose between standard giant, ancient giant, wotan, or ice giant.
***Giant Slam.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage due to your size.
> ##### Optional Rule: Damage Spread
> Much like a cannon, a giant's fist or weapon would not only damage to a single target, but also the creatures and objects around it that cannot dodge. This damage spread DC may be calculated the same way cannons are, but alternative rulings (such as based of the strength modifier) may be used.
>
> Due to this ruling and the size of the race, giants are a DM race and may not be used that often in any games.
#### Standard Giant
You are a giant, your strength and size is fearsome.
***Natural Athlete.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.
***Warrior's Might.*** When you successfully hit with an attack, you can choose to deal the maximum damage of your weapon dice. You regain this ability at the end of a short or long rest.
***Giant's Endurance.*** As a reaction to taking damage, you can reduce the damage by 1d12 + your Constitution Modifier. You have three uses of this ability and regain all uses at the end of a short or long rest.
#### Ancient Giant
You are one of the few remnants of the ancient giant clan. They say that even regular giants are mere dwarves to the ancient giants. Some have been known to pull continents.
***Thick Skin.*** Your Armor Class is equal to 14 + your Constitution modifier.
***Fear Factor.*** Your size and the horns and teeth that adorn your visage send chills down the spines of most men. You have advantage on Intimidation checks against any creature that is at least one size smaller than you.
***Natural Weapons.*** All of your unarmed strikes deal 1d10 damage. You can use their teeth and horns to deal piercing damage.
***Titanic Strength.*** At no point does your strength falter. Whenever you make a strength check, you can treat the dice roll as a 10, and add additional modifiers.
#### Wotan
