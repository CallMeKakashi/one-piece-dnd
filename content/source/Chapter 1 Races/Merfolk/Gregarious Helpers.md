### Gregarious Helpers

Merfolk delight in song, music, and all forms of community-based entertainment. Theirs is a tight-knit community that lacks social stigma or class differences, each individual is treated as a cherished part of the community as long as they are honest and kind-hearted in turn.
Merfolk and fishmen typically consider themselves kin of each other and rarely make a difference between the two. Interbreeding between the two races has an equal chance of producing either a merfolk or fishman child, and most carry genes from both species with them resulting in a sense of unity and equality between the two races.
Merfolk may still have some reservations about humans, but these prejudices typically stem from fear or ignorance, which can usually be remedied through nothing but a few minutes of pleasant conversation. Most merfolk would much rather make a new friend rather than an enemy, and typically treat strangers as potential friends or allies with more open-mindedness than most other species.
Merfolk's friendly and approachable nature isn't limited only to other sapient beings. All mermaids can communicate and speak with fish, having a much easier time doing so than even fishmen. They can use this ability to call fish to their aid, which can be used for scouting or to gather information on the surrounding waters.
