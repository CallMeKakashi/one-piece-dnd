### Deep Sea Monarchs

While not as physically imposing or martially bent as fishmen, merfolk have a keen eye for politics and diplomacy, being the current rulers of Fishman Island under King Neptune. While the common fishman has the advantage in a one-on-one fight, the merfolk's ability to organize and manage a standing army makes them the obvious figureheads in politics with the surface world.
Merfolk do not possess the same sense of superiority found in some fishmen however, and the two races co-inhabit Fishman Island in perfect harmony with extremely few instances of political unrest or infighting.
Merfolk are very hospitable and welcoming to travelers that reach Fishman Island, which is a common occurrence as it's the only way to travel from Paradise to the New World. As long as visitors come in peace and with no ill intent, the merfolk will graciously host any traveler during their stay whether they are pirates or marine soldiers.
