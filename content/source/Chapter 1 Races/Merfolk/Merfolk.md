## Merfolk

Merfolk are humanoid creatures with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a marine creature, typically a fish or an octopus. Unlike fishmen, the human side of merfolk does not necessarily bear any piscine features, though it is not unheard of for some merfolk to have more marine traits such as fins or webbed fingers.
Related to the fishmen, merfolk make their home beneath the Red Line on fishman island. The two races exist in harmony, sharing a similar difficult history with the surface world and the races that inhabit it. But whereas fishmen are feared and infamous for being savages, merfolk have a much more favorable reputation among humans as beings of extreme beauty. Sadly, this reputation only serves to make them more desirable as slaves on the underworld markets, leading to many cases of abductions at the hands of pirates.
Despite these unfortunate circumstances, merfolk have remained firmly open-minded towards all other races, including humans. Kind-hearted and gregarious to a fault, merfolk have a reputation for saving drowning sailors from the depths only to disappear moments afterwards.
