## Fishman

Ten times stronger than the common man and undisputed monarchs of the sea, the fishmen of the world oceans were for the longest time the boogeymen of sailors everywhere. Tall and proud warriors of the deep, the fishmen share a troubled history of racial discrimination and slavery at the hands of humans, scars that even centuries of peace with the surface world has yet to completely mend.
A lot of the prejudice against them stems from how they differ from humans, looking monstrous to the common man because of their half-fish, half-human physiology, but also because of their renowned physical superiority and ability to fight as well on land as in water.
Despite their fearsome reputation as pirates and marauders, the fishmen are not a simple or militaristic race of savages that many humans believe them to be. A fishman dedicated to a crew or a cause tends to be loyal to a fault, willing to fight to the bitter end for what they believe in.
