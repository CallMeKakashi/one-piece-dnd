### A history of strife

For centuries, the fishmen were considered little more than any other monster in the oceans by the humans and were treated accordingly, only welcome on the surface world as slaves if they weren't killed on sight. Eventually, the world government realized the benefits of peace between the races and made several attempts to mend the relationship between humans, fishmen, and merfolk. Thanks in part to the actions of the fishman pirate Fisher Tiger and the merfolk queen Otohime, a peaceful coexistence was finally reached after decades of negotiations.
However, the old ways still rings loudly in the ears of both humans and fishmen alike, who have had a hard time leaving the past behind. Many humans, especially nobles, still consider fishmen to be nothing but monsters and fish. Conversely, many fishmen subscribe to the notion that their superior strength and adaptability means they should be ruling over humans, who they consider weak and cowardly.
Even so, a strained peace still aided in softening the animosity between the races, and more fishmen and humans alike are beginning to wake up to the idea of co-existence, slowly beginning to see each other as kin rather than enemies.
