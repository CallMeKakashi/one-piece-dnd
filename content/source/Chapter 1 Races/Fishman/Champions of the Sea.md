### Champions of the Sea

In water, fishmen are second to none. Already on land, a fishman can boast the strength of ten common humans, and this strength is only amplified by their amphibious nature. A fishman possesses both the gills of a fish and the respiratory system of a human, allowing them to breathe air and water without issue, while dorsal fins and webbed hands and feet allow them to move unhindered in water.
In addition to these boons, fishmen have a unique form of martial arts known as Fishman Karate, which emphasizes the use of water to their advantage. This unique fighting style is only taught at certain dojos on fishman island and has a near-mythical reputation that reaches even the surface world above.
