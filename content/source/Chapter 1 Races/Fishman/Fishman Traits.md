***Ability Score Increase.*** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another one increases by 1. Alternatively, three ability scores of your choice increase by 1.
***Age.*** Fishmen reach adulthood in their late teens and live as long as humans.
***Alignment.*** Fishmen display extremes on the moral scales, with good-aligned fishmen typically being chaotic good with a great emphasis on personal freedom, while evil-aligned fishmen tend towards lawful evil with the ideals that their superior physique means they should rule over other races.
***Size.*** Fishmen vary greatly in size and typically stand taller than humans at 7-8 feet up to 15 feet. Your size is your choice of small or medium.
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
***Aquatic Adaption.*** You can breathe air and water. You have advantage on all Strength (Athletic) ability checks made while in water. In addition, you gain resistance to cold damage.
***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to the dark ocean floors where light is scarce, you have darkvision out to 60 feet and can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, lift, and for grapple and shove attempts.
***Speech of the Sea.*** You can communicate simple ideas and words to creatures with a natural swimming speed that are of large size or smaller. Most sealife cannot form or understand complicated messages, but can communicate simple expressions and desires such as fear, hunger or joy.
***Subraces.*** Choose between sharptooth, stronghide or multipod.
#### Sharptooth
Sharptooth fishmen typically have the physiological traits of a predator, such as a shark, pirahana, angler-fish, etc. They use their sharp teeth or spines to tear enemies asunder if provoked. Often their toothy jaws are able to send a message to startle even the most brave individuals.
***Frightening.*** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
***Natural Weapons.*** You have sharp claws, teeth, or spines that can be used as weapons. Your unarmed strikes deal piercing or slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage.
#### Stronghide
Stronghide fishmen develop powerful bodies that further amplify their innate strength and endurance, allowing them to become remarkable martial artists and fighters. Fishmen of this type are often very big and take after blowfish, groupers, and whale sharks.
***Natural Athlete.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.
***Strong Body.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
#### Multipod
Multipod fishmen are recognizable by their extra arms, possessing as many as eight functioning limbs. These types of fishmen are typically squids and octopuses, and while not technically fish, still fall under the umbrella of fishmen species. Having been born with multiple limbs, they are natural masters of dual-wielding, and are quite agile with their hands.
***Manual Agility.*** You have proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill.
***Ambidextrous.*** Having grown up your whole life with extra arms, you gain the benefits of the Two Weapon Fighting Style, allowing you to add your damage modifier when you engage in two weapon fighting. Despite having multiple arms, you can still only attack once with your bonus action and cannot dual wield two handed weapons. As well as not benefiting from multiple shields.
