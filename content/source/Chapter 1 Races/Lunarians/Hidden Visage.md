### Hidden Visage

Lunarians, at least the survivors, hide their faces from the world. Siding with powerful figures that can oppose the World Government's influence, or donning a suit that hides every inch of their skin, Lunarians would do anything to keep their identity a secret.
Lunarians do their best to keep their identities secret, even killing those who see their true face. When a Lunarian does reveal their nature, it is only to people they trust above all else.
> ##### DM's Note
> Lunarians as a race are optional, they are a DM Race, meaning mostly used for NPCs, but can be used for players if the DM allows it. To the DMs, don't feel pressured by players to allow it if it will wreck your plans for story and balance. They are essentially Aarakocras but with the ability to inherently cast fire spells, move extremely fast, and have resistance to essentially all damage.
>
>Due to their rarity, if you do allow players to choose it, only one of them being it is the best choice. Also, if the player's race is ever revealed to the public, this is generally bad news for the party as World Government will do anything in their power to kill and/or capture the rest of the Lunarians, a situation that will likely end the party.

> Do not cave, and if you do, do not hold back.
