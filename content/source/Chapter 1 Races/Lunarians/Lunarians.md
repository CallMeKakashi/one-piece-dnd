## Lunarians

Lunarians are a race of humanoid creatures, set apart by the other races due to their dark brown skin, silvery-white hair, and a set of large, black, feathery wings that grant them flight. Additionally, they have the inherited ability of pyrokinesis, some of which can burn as hot as magma.
While most of their history is unknown, it is confirmed that before the Celestial Dragons had made their home, Mary Geoise, on top of the Red Line, the Lunarians lived there. The Lunarians were so powerful, that they were known as Gods, their home being referred to as the "Kingdom of The Gods". Upon the arrival of the Celestial Dragons, the Lunarians were likely mostly wiped out, and the few that went into hiding were hunted down like dogs.
Lunarians are a rare find these days, as the World Government still offers high cash rewards for even the slightest information on their locations.
