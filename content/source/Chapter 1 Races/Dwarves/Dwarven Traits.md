***Age.*** Unknown, but appears to age around the same pace as most of the humanoid races.
***Alignment.*** Dwarves are generally good due to their kind and trusting nature, however due to their desires to stay hidden, they often take extreme measures, making them lean towards chaos.

***Elusive.*** As a bonus action, you can take either the Disengage or Hide action.

***Gullible.*** Dwarves have disadvantage on Insight checks to see if someone is lying.
> ##### DM's Note
> Dwarves, much like Lunarians, are also a DM race. A player can use it with permission from the DM, but being tiny could make some encounters challenging. Though size is not as a big factor as Lunarians or Giants, it can still be tricky.
