## Dwarves

Dwarves are a race of small humanoid creatures. They are so small, that humans are essentially giants to them. They are mostly human in appearance, with chibi-like proportions, and often have pointed noses. Members of the Tontatta Tribe have thick fluffy tails.
Most Dwarves shown in the canon have been part of the Tontatta tribe, however other tribes do seem to exist.
