### A Little Gullible

Dwarves casually ask people whether they are good or bad and as a tradition, a good person can prove him/herself by either giving up their weapons or being stripped of all their possessions. Dwarves are very careful not to be seen by any humans as they will try to kill anyone who sees them unless they promise not to tell anyone of their existence. They are also gullible to anything humans say to them, making them simple to be motivated.
