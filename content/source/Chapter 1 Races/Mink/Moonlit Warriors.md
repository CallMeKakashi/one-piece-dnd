### Moonlit Warriors

All minks tend to be stronger than normal humans, possessing formidable physical abilities typical to their animalistic side, such as strong legs that can scale trees in a single leap, or powerful muscles for physical labor. Their abilities do not remarkably deteriorate with age, and this combined with an effective metabolism and recovery rate makes them formidable fighters in battle.
Adding to that, minks have two additional abilities that serve to differentiate them from humans: Electro, the ability to generate powerful electrical charges through their fur, and Sulong, the ability to transform into an even more powerful form while under the light of the full moon.
Sulong is the most feared ability of the minks, known to transform them into unstoppable, rampaging beasts. Only a few minks master this ability, as loss of control can result in the death of not just their enemies, but their allies and even themselves as well. While transformed, a mink grows increasingly ferocious as their fur grows out, their muscles tense and their claws extend, becoming a frightful sight to behold by their enemies.
