### Mink Traits

As a mink, you have the following traits.
***Ability Score Increase.*** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another one increases by 1. Alternatively, three ability scores of your choice increase by 1.
***Age.*** Minks reach adulthood in their late teens and live as long as humans.
***Alignment.*** Minks are generally gregarious and friendly, though they focus on their own community over contact with other races, making them lawful good.
***Size.*** Minks vary greatly in size due to their animal heritage, but typically are comparable to humans. Your size is your choice of small or medium.
***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.
***Darkvision.*** You are accustomed to the dark forests of Zou. You have darkvision out to 60 feet and can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
***Natural Weapons.*** Due to your appearance being based upon an animal, you also gain their natural weapons, such as the claws of a lion, the teeth of a wolf, the horns of a ram, or even the fists of an ape. You have natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you can deal one of either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. You can choose whether to use Strength or Dexterity when attacking with these natural weapons, but must use the same ability score for both the attack and damage roll.
***Inner Beast.*** You can draw upon your bestial blood to greatly boost your speed and strength for a short time. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself advantage on all Strength and Dexterity-based ability checks for 1 minute. During this time, your speed increases by 10 and when you use your Electro trait, you deal additional lightning damage equal to your level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this trait again.
If the full moon is visible when you make this transformation, you enter Sulong form for the duration, increasing both your Strength and Dexterity scores by 4. This increase can exceed an ability score of 20, but not 30. When this sulong form ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.
***Electro.*** All minks can generate electricity through their fur. Once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack, you can choose to deal lightning damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. When dealing lightning damage with this attack, the target then cannot take reactions until the start of your next turn.
***Subrace.*** Choose between diurnal or nocturnal.
#### Diurnal
Diurnal minks are primarily awake and active during the day. Due to catching sunlight, they do most of the agricultural work among the mink.
***Diurnal Nature.*** You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, History, Medicine, Nature, or Persuasion.
#### Nocturnal
Nocturnal minks are primarily awake and active during the night. Owing to their nightly activities, they make excellent scouts and defenders.
***Nocturnal Nature.*** You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.
