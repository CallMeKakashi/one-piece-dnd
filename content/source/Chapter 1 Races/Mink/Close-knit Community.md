### Close-knit Community

The island of Zou rests on the back of a giant, millenia-old elephant known as Zunesha. Truthfully, however, despite having been hunted for slaves by human pirates in the past, minks are exceptionally welcoming and hospitable to all manners of visitors that come in good faith to their island.
Minks have a tight-knit community on their island, making no difference between themselves regardless of a mink's features. They show affection to eachother through physical contact or acts of generosity, having next to no concept of personal space even between relative strangers. "Garchu", a common practice among minks, consists of rubbing their temple or cheek against each other, signifying a greeting or act of gratitude.
Each individual mink takes after a specific fur-covered mammalian creature, and recognize differences in their kin by referring to canine minks as such, for example. However, mink do not differentiate from each other, and carnivorous minks live side by side with herbivorous minks. Mink society places a stigma on eating animals with fur, and as such their diet primarily consists of reptiles, fish and greens found on the island of Zou.
