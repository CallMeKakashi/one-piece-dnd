## Mink

The mysterious mink tribe is a race of fur-covered, anthropomorphic humanoids from the "phantom island" of Zou in the New World, a moving island situated atop the back of an ancient, millenium old elephant known as Zunesha. Because of its unique location, Zou is impossible to find with a logpose, hiding the minks away from the eyes of the world as a result. While most humans go their entire lives without ever seeing a mink, the rumors of Zou's formidable sentinels carry far and wide across the new world, telling tales of the minks' mythical ability to wield electricity like a weapon and transform into vicious beasts beneath the light of the full moon.
