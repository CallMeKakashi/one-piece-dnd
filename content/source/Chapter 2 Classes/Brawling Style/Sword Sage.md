### Sword Sage

Sword Sages are brawlers that have extensively trained with multiple weapons and fighting styles, so much so that they can use a weapon as effectively as their own hand. Their flexibility in combat makes them dangerous in any situation, whether armed to the teeth or wielding a random weapon on the battlefield.
#### Combat Mastery
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in all martial weapons, and all weapons that you are proficient in count as brawler weapons. In addition, you can draw and stow a weapon as part of making an attack with it.
#### Fighting Style
Starting at 3rd level, your training gives you experience in a range of fighting styles and enables you to refocus yourself through meditation. You may choose one fighting style from the options given in Chapter 5, in the Sword Sage Brawler Styles section, and may change your fighting style whenever you complete a long rest.
#### Sage Strikes
At 6th level, whenever you use Flurry of blows or your bonus action attack from Martial Arts, you can replace the unarmed strikes with an attack with a brawler weapon.
#### Spirit Strike
At 6th level, you can utilize your innate fighting spirit to attack like an unstoppable bastion. When you hit a target with a brawler weapon, you can spend 1 Spirit point to cause the weapon to deal an extra 2d6 damage to the target of that weapon's damage type.
#### Perfected Form
At 11th level, you have mastered and refined more styles of combat, making you all the more versatile. You can choose one additional fighting style, and may now change fighting style(s) whenever you complete a short rest.
#### Spirit Warrior
At 17th level, your mastery of spirit and combat allows you to enter a state of pure focus, rendering you an ultimate warrior one with body, mind, spirit, and blade.
At the start of your turn, you may spend five Spirit points so that for the next minute you may take an extra bonus action on each of your turns.
In addition, for the duration, once per turn, when you use your Spirit Strike feature, you may ignore the Spirit point cost.
This ability ends early if you are incapacitated or killed.
