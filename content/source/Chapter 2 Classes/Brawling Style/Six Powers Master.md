### Six Powers Master

Six Powers is a classified martial art practiced by the Navy and World Government, allowing the practioner to move and strike at superhuman levels, having six primary techniques revolving around offense, defense, and mobility in combat.
#### Six Techniques
Beginning at 3rd level, you've mastered a few of the signature techniques of Rokushiki.
Choose three of the following techniques. You gain the benefits of the chosen techniques immediately.
* **Moon Walk.** As a bonus action, you can spend 1 spirit point to grant yourself a flight speed equal to half walking speed for one minute.
* **Iron Body.** As a reaction to taking damage, you can halve it. Afterwards, your movement speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.
* **Finger Pistol.** As part of making an unarmed strike, you can make the attack deal piercing damage, and you increase the size of the damage dice roll. For example 1d6 => 1d8, 1d10 => 1d12.
* **Tempest Kick.** In the place of an unarmed strike, you can instead make a ranged attack with a range of 60 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is slashing, and its damage die is a d6. This die changes as you gain brawler levels, as shown in the Brawling column of the Brawler table.
* **Shave.** As a bonus action on your turn you can teleport 15ft. Alternatively, you can use a reaction when a creature targets you with an attack, you can spend 1 spirit point to impose disadvantage on the attack and then teleport 15ft. You cannot use this feature if your movement speed is 0.
* **Paper Art.** As a reaction when a creature hits you with an attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to your AC against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.
When you reach 6th level in this class, you gain the remaining 3 techniques you didn't choose at 3rd level.
#### Enhanced Technique
At 11th level, you chose two of the six techniques you've mastered to make your specialties. The chosen technique grows stronger as shown below.
* **Moon Walk.** When you use Moon Walk, you can now use your full movement speed when flying. While flying this way, opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage.
* **Iron Body.** You can now use any of your movement and still retain the benefits of this technique. Your unarmed strikes also harden, allowing you to add half your proficiency bonus rounded down to your attack and damage rolls.
* **Finger Pistol.** You now score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the attack roll with your unarmed strikes, and Finger Pistol can now work with any weapon that you wield and are proficient in.

* **Tempest Kick.** The range of your tempest kick increases to 120 and ignores any resistance to slashing damage. The attack now deals double damage to objects and structures, as well.
* **Shave.** The distance you can teleport with this technique increases to 30 feet, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make after teleporting like this.
* **Paper Art.** When you use Paper Art, you can choose to spend a spirit point to make the bonus to your AC granted by this technique now persists until the start of your next turn, not only against the triggering attack. It persists even if the triggering attack still hits.
When you reach 17th level in this class, you gain the remaining four enhanced techniques you didn't choose at 11th level.
#### Six King Gun
At 17th level, you learn the secret seventh technique of Six Powers, available only to those who master the common six techniques.
As an action, you exert a blast of force from your hands that is 5ft wide and 30ft long, expending up to 10 spirit points. Any creatures within this area must make a Constitution saving throw against your Spirit DC, taking 2d10 force damage per spirit point spent on a failed save, and half that on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies immediately.
