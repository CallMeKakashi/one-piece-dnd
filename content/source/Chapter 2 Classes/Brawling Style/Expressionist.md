### Expressionist

While brawlers tend to make their mark on the world with their fists, Expressionists take an alternative approach. These brawlers mix their spiritual experiences with thier own forms of art, be in making gadgets, creating art, or some other form. These brawlers are able to weave these experiences into tactics and techniques they could use in everyday life. Expressionists are often painters, inventors, or even something else entirely, travelling around to bring something new to the world.

#### Creativity (Spellcasting)
At 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to use creations. You have a notebook containing creations that show the first glimmerings of your true potential. See the gadgeteer creation list under "Gadgeteer Creations by Level". (Creativity is synonymous with 5th edition Spellcasting. See "Casting a Spell" in the _Player's Handbook_ for the general rules of Spellcasting in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition).
##### Tricks (Cantrips)
You know three tricks of your choice from the gadgeteer creations list.
You learn additional gadgeteer tricks of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Tricks Known column of the Expressionist table.
At the end of a long rest, you can change one of the tricks you know for another from your creation list.
##### Preparing and Using Creations (Preparing and Casting Spells)
The Expressionist table shows how many creation slots you have to use your gadgeteer creations of 1st Level and higher. You regain all expended creation slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of gadgeteer creations that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of gadgeteer creations⁠ from your notebook equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Expressionist level rounded down (minimum of one creation). The creations⁠ must be of a level for which you have creation slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level Expressionist, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level creation slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared creations can include four creations of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level creation Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the creation doesn't remove it from your list of prepared creations.
You can change your list of prepared creations when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of gadgeteer creations requires time spent tinkering with your creation casting focuses: at least 1 minute per creation level for each creation on your list.
##### Creative Ability (Spellcasting Ability)
Wisdom is your creative ability for your gadgeteer creations, as you learn through careful study and observation, trial and error. You use your Wisdom whenever a creation refers to your creative⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for the gadgeteer creations you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
**Creation save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
**Creation Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
#### Spiritual Gimmicks
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Intelligence (Engineering) checks and Tinker's Tools, or expertise if you already have proficiency in each skill respectively. Any brawler weapon or Tinker's Tool you wield can count as a creative focus for your creations.
In addition, your creative spirit and experiences allow you to modify your creations. When you use a creation, you can modify it in one of the following ways:
* When you use a creation with a casting time of one action, you can expend a number of spirit points equal to the level of the creation to instead cast it as a bonus action. The cost is 1 if you use this to cast a trick as a bonus action.
* When you use a creation with a range of 5 feet or greater, you can double the range of the creation at the cost of 1 spirit point. If the range is touch, the range instead becomes 30 feet.
* When you use a creation, you can spend 1 spirit point to use the creation without any verbal or somatic components.
* When you use a creation that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of spirit points equal to the creation's level to target a second creature in range with the same creation. The cost is 1 if you use this with a trick.
* When you use a creation that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the creature's full force. To do so, you spend 1 spirit point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the creation, and takes no damage if they would usually take half on a successful save.
#### Potent Expression
Starting at 6th level, you can seemlessly weave your creations with your martial arts. You can add your Wisdom modifier to any damage rolls made with creations.
In addition, when you use a creation, you can use your bonus action with an unarmed strike, or use Flurry of Blows.
#### Flexible Spirit
At 11th level, your creative spirit can act as fuel towards your tricks and creations. As an action, you can transform of a number of Spirit points into creation slots. You can create creation slots no higher in level than 5th, and only slots of which you are able to cast. Any creation slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a short or long rest.
The conversion rates are listed in the Flexible Spirit table below.
##### Flexible Spirit
| Slot Level | Spirit Point Cost |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |
#### Signature Creations
At 17th level, you have mastered your creative style, enabling you to recreate low creations at will.
Choose a 1st and 2nd level Gadgeteer creation that you have prepared, you can now use those creations at their lowest level without expending a creation slot.
You can spend 8 hours of downtime adjusting your creations, allowing you to switch your Signature Creations.
