### Chromatic Commandment

There is potential in all creatures, an energy stirring and waiting to be released. Those who follow the ways of this energy are known as the Chromatic Commandment, able the transform the potential energy of their spirit into an overwhelming force of nature through their mastery and understanding of their place in the natural order. This energy acts as both their sword and shield against all other forces as they command the elements themselves to surround them.
#### Spirit Fist
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel your spirit into your unarmed strikes, causing it to burst with elemental energy.
At the end of a long rest, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage. When you damage a target with an unarmed strike, you can change the damage type to the chosen type.
In addition, as a bonus action, you can spend 1 spirt point to surround yourself with your chosen element.  For 10 minutes, the elements surround you. You determine their appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.
While the elements are present, you gain the following benefits:
* You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* Your unarmed strikes can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is of the one you chose at the end of a long rest.
* You gain darkvision for 120 feet.
#### Spirit Unleashed
Starting at 6th level, you can channel your spirit to produce destructive waves of energy, expanding the reach of your attacks. You gain the following beneifts while you are surrounded by the elements from Spirit Fist:
* When you make an unarmed strike, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
* When you use your bonus action to dash or disengage, you unleash a burst of elements, giving you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed that lasts until the end of your turn.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a wave of elements in either a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spirit save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as the one you chose at the end of a long rest from Spirit Fist. At 11th level, the damage of this feature increases to four rolls of your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 Spirit point to use this feature again.
#### Chromatic Aura
Starting at 11th level, the elements you unleash form an aura around you. While you are surrounded by the elements from Spirit Fist, you gain the following benefits:
* You and each creature of your choice within 10ft of you have resistance to the damage type you chose at the end of a long rest from Spirit Fist.
* When you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier + your brawler level.
* Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with your unarmed strike, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. They type is the same as the one you selected from Spirit Fist.
#### Ascendant Aspect
