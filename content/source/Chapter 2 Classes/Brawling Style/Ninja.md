#### Bonus Proficiencies
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with katanas and longbows, and they count as brawler weapons for you. Additionally, you gain proficiency in Stealth (Dexterity) checks, unless you were already proficient, instead gaining expertise.
#### Ninja Arts
At 3rd level, you can use your spirit to replicate the effects of certain creations. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to use one of the following creations: Darkness, Darkvision, Pass Without a Trace, Silence, Fog Cloud, Disguise, and Invisibility without providing material components.
Additionally, you gain the Temporary Trick trick if you don't already know it. All of these creations use your Spirit DC.

#### Vanishing Step
At 6th level, you gain the ability to cross vast distances while hidden. While you are successfully hidden, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.
#### Paralysis Jutsu
At 11th level, you gain the ability to lock a target in a paralyzing technique. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 3 spirit points to paralyze them.
