### Soul Of Artifice

At 20th level, you develop a connection to your mastercraft items, which you can draw on for protection:
- You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per active mod you have.
- If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your mods, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.
