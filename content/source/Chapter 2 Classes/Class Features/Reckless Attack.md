### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to a⁠ttack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon a⁠ttack rolls using Strength during this turn, but atta⁠ck rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
