### Duplicitious Strike

Starting at 14th level, your machinations during duels run especially deep. The following effects are added to your Devious Strike options.
**Daze (Cost: 3d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.
**Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
**Obscure (Cost: 3d6).** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.
