### Creativity (Spellcasting)

You have learned to create medicines and poisons potent enough to pass for magic among common folk. See the medic creation list under "Medic Creations by Level". (Creativity is synonymous with 5th edition Spellcasting. See "Casting a Spell" in the _Player's Handbook_ for the general rules of Spellcasting in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition).
#### Tricks (Cantrips)
At 1st level, you know three tricks of your choice from the medic creations list. You learn additional medic tricks of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Tricks Known column of the Medic table.
At the end of a long rest, you can change one of the tricks you know for another from your creation list.
#### Preparing and Using Creations (Preparing and Casting Spells)
The Medic table shows how many creation slots you have to use your medic creations of 1st level and higher. To use one of these medic creations⁠, you must expend a slot of the creation’s level or higher. You regain all expended creation slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of medic creations that are available for you to cast, choosing from the medic creation list. When you do so, choose a number of medic creations equal to your Wisdom modifier + your medic level (minimum of one creation). The creations⁠ must be of a level for which you have creation slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level medic, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level creation slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared creations can include six creations⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level creation _cure wounds_, you can use it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Using the creation doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared creations⁠.
You can also change your list of prepared creations when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of medic creations⁠ requires time spent working with your medicinal components: at least 1 minute per creation level for each creation on your list.
#### Creative⁠ Ability (Spellcasting Ability)
Wisdom is your creative ability for your medic creations. Your creations are medicinal restoratives and potent poisons that require a perceptive eye and hand to mix properly. You use your Wisdom whenever a creation refers to your creative⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a medic creation you use and when making an attack roll with one.
**Creation save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
**Creation Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
#### Routine Usage (Ritual Casting)
You can use any medic creation you know as a routine if that creation has the routine tag.
#### Apparatus (Spellcasting Focus)
You can use alchemist's supplies or a herbalism kit as an apparatus for your medic creations.
