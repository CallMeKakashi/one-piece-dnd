### Mods

At 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain mechanical mods, turning those objects into mastercraft items.
#### Mods Known
When you gain this feature, pick four gadgeteer mods to learn. You learn additional mods of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Mods Known column of the Artificer table.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.
#### Modifiying an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch an object and improve it with one of your mods, turning it into a mastercraft item. A mod works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the mod's description.
Your mod remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the mod vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The mod also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the mod.
You can modify more than one object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Mods Known column of the Gadgeteer table. You must touch each of the objects. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your mods at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of mods, the oldest mod ends, and then the new mod applies.
If a mod ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.
If a mod that gives a +1-3 bonus to an item is placed on another item that already has a +1-3 bonus, the highest one takes effect.
#### List Of Mods
Gadgeteer modes turn a mundane object into a mastercraft item. The description of each of the following mods details the type of object that can receive it. Some mods specify a minimum gadgeteer level. You can't learn such a mod until you are at least that level. Unless a mod's description says otherwise, you can't learn a mod more than once.
