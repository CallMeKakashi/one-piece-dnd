### Action Surge

Starting at 2nd Level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and an extra bonus action.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
