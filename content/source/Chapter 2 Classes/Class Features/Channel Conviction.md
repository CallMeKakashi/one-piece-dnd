### Channel Conviction

At 3rd level, you also gain the Channel Conviction features of your subclass. Your powerful soul allows you to channel your inner power to fuel fantastic effects. Each Channel Conviction option provided by your code explains how to use it.
When you use your Channel Conviction, you choose which effect to use. You must finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Conviction again.
Some Channel Conviction effects require a saving throw. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your savant creation save DC.
