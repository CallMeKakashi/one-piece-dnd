### Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by any ranged attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the att⁠ack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your brawler level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch it if you have a free hand. If you catch it in this way, you can spend 1 spirit point to make a ranged att⁠ack with the weapon or ammunition you caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this atta⁠ck with proficiency, and the missile counts as a brawler weapon for the att⁠ack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. You do not have close range disadvantage with this attack.
