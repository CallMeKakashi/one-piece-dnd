### Indomitable

Beginning at 9th level, you can, with advantage, reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 13th level and three times between rests starting at 17th level.
