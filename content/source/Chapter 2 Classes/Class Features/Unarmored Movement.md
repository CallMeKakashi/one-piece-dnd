### Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd Level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain brawler levels, as shown in the Brawler table.
Additionally, as a bonus action, you can take the Disengage or Dash action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
