### Land's Stride

Starting at 8th level, your constant travels enable you to cross any hazard that comes your way at a quick pace. Your movement speed cannot be reduced or impeded by hazards or physical obstruction such as difficult terrain, climbing, swimming, etc. This does not extend to effects such as being grappled, restrained, and incapacitated.
In addition, as a bonus action, you can take the dash action.
