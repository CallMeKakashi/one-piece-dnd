### Harmonic Vitality

Beginning at 2nd Level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies. When you use an ability or creation that restores hit points, you can increase the total number of hit points restored by 1d6.
The bonus to healing increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 5th level, to 1d10 at 10th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.
