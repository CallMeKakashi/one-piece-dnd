### Killshot

At 20th level, your aim becomes completely unerring and extremely lethal.
If you hit a creature marked as your Favored Mark with a weapon attack and the target has 25 hit points remaining or less, you can choose to cause it die instantly. On a critical hit, this threshold increases to 50 hit points or less.
