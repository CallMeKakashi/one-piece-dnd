### Volley

Starting at 9th level, you can unleash volleys of ranged attacks upon enemies. When you take the Attack action and attack with a ranged weapon, you can choose one target within range of the weapon and make a single weapon attack against it and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it as part of the same action.
