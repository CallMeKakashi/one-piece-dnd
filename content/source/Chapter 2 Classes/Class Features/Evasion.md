### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a _fireball_ creation. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
