### Ardent Soul

Your soul flares with a passion unlike the common man, which manifests occasionally as a disposition towards elemental forces: Burning Passion, Caustic Spite, Cold Indifference, Fulminating Glee, Mindful Insight, Necrotic Mania, Radiant Superiority, Thundering Resolve or Venomous Duality, all detailed at the end of the class description.
Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and then again at 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 20th level.
