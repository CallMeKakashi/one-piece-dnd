### Devious Strike

Starting at 5th Level, you can outwit any foe while in combat with a combination of dexterity and deception. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Devious Strike options below. Each option has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. An attack can only have one Devious Strike option at a time.
If a Devious Strike requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.
**Trip (Cost: 1d6).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
**Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
