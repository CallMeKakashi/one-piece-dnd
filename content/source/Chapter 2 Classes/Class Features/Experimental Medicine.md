### Experimental Medicine

Starting at 2nd level, you've developed a type of medicine that massively boosts your physical abilities for an extended period. The medicine is tailored to your physiology, and only you can benefit from it.
As an action on your turn, you can administer this special medicine to yourself, granting you temporary hit points equal to four times your level in this class. When you administer this medicine, additionally choose one of the following enhancements to gain:
* **Hulking Strength.** You gain an immense surge in Strength for the duration, causing your Strength score to be set to a number equal to your Wisdom score unless it's already higher. Additionally, your unarmed strikes and any melee weapon you wield in this form deal 1d8 damage of the weapon's type instead of the normal damage.
* **Nimble Dexterity.** You gain a sudden burst of agility and speed, causing your Dexterity score to be set to a number equal to your Wisdom score unless it's already higher, and increasing your speed by 10 feet.
* **Resilient Constitution.** You're imbued with a strong and hearty vigor, causing your Constitution score to be set to a number equal to your Wisdom score unless it's already higher, and granting advantage on Constitution saving throws.
The medicine's effects last for a number of hours equal to half your Medic level rounded down, if your hit points reach 0, or if you willingly end it as a bonus action. If you lose all temporary hit points gained by this effect, the enhancement remains in effect for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. While the medicine is active, you can change the enhancement you gained as an action on your turn, for instance changing from Hulking Strength to Nimble Dexterity or back. You lose the effects of the previous enhancement and replace them with the new one when you do this.
You can use this feature twice, and regain all uses when you finish a short or long rest.
