### Creation Storage

At 11th level, you can now store a creation in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a creation focus, and you store a creation in it, choosing a creation from the artificer creation list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared) and be of a level equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up).
While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the creation's effect from it, using your creation ability modifier. If the creation requires concentration, the creature must concentrate.
The creation stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this
feature again to store a creation in an object.
