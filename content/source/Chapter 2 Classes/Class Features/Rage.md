### Rage

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, or unarmed strike, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to your proficiency bonus.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute, or if you choose to end it early (no action required). It ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you don heavy armor.
You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
