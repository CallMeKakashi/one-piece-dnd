### Creativity

At 2nd level, your passionate soul finally stirs enough to awaken the power slumbering within. (Creativity is synonymous with 5th edition Spellcasting. See "Casting a Spell" in the _Player's Handbook_ for the general rules of Spellcasting in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition).
#### Preparing and Using Creations (Spell Slots)
The Savant table shows how many creation slots you have to play your savant creations of 1st Level and higher. To play one of these creations⁠, you must expend a slot of the creation’s level or higher. You regain all expended creation slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of savant creations that are available for you to use, choosing from the savant creation list. When you do so, choose a number of savant creations equal to your Charisma modifier + half your savant level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The creations must be of a level for which you have creation slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level savant, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level creation slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared creations can include four creations of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. For example, if you prepare the 1st-level creation _longstrider_ and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level creation slot available, you can use _longstrider_ with either slot.
You can change your list of prepared creations when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of savant creations requires time spent in focus and creative pursuit: at least 1 minute per creation level for each creation on your list.
#### Creative⁠ Ability (Spellcasting Ability)
Charisma is your creative ability for your savant creations. Your creations are not physical items, but rather manifestations of your burning passion and innate talent. You use your Charisma whenever a creation refers to your creative⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a savant creation you play and when making an attack roll with one.
**Creation save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
**Creation Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
#### Apparatus (Spellcasting Focus)
You can use a memento as an apparatus for your savant creations.
