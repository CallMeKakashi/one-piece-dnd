### Favored Mark

You can use your uncanny precision to mark a target for termination. As a bonus action, you can mark a creature that
you can see as your favored mark for 1 hour or until you mark another creature.
You don't have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks at long range against the marked target, and once per turn when you hit a marked target with a weapon attack you can choose to deal an additional 1d6 damage to it. If the target of your mark is reduced to 0 hit points, you can immediately use your reaction to mark
another creature without expending a use of this feature.
Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to spot the mark.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all uses
when you finish a short or long rest. The damage from this mark increases as you gain levels in this class, becoming d8 at 5th level, d10 at 14th level, and d12 at 20th level.
