### Rapid Remedy

At 5th level, your treatment procedures are fast acting and effective. When you use a creation that restores hit points to a creature with a creation slot of 1st level or higher, you can choose to have the creation count as being cast with one creation slot higher. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.
At 10th level, all of your creations that restore hit points can benefit from this feature, no longer requiring any uses.
