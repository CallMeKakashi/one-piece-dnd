### Musical Secrets

At 10th level, you've gathered inspiration from creations of a wide spectrum of disciplines.
Choose two creations from any class creation list found in this document, including this one. The creation must be of a level you can use, as shown on the Bard table, or a trick.
The chosen creations count as bard creations for you and are included in the Creations Known column on the Bard table.
You learn two additional creations from any classes at 14th and again at 18th level.
