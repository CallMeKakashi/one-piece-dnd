### Rallying Presence

At 1st level, your strong personality inspires allies on the battlefield, allowing them to catch their breath and have a second wind.
You have a pool of inspiring energy equal to five times your savant level that replenishes on a long rest. As an action, you can touch a willing creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in that pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 of these hit points to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple Diseases and neutralize multiple Poisons with a single use of this ability, expending Hit Points separately for each one.
