### Ardent Smite

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one creation slot to deal damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level creation slot, plus 1d8 for each creation level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8.
