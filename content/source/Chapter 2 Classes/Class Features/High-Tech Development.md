### High-Tech Development

At 11th level, your engineering prowess and creative works have granted you access to powerful creations. Choose one creation of 6th level or lower from the Gadgeteer creation list.
You can use this creation once without expending a creation slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
At higher levels, you gain more Gadgeteer creations of your choice that can be activated in this way: one creation of 7th-level or lower at 13th level, one creation 8th-level or lower at 15th level, and one creation of 9th-level or lower at 17th level. You regain all uses of your High-Tech Development when you finish a long rest. You can change out one of these creations with another of the same level when you finish a long rest.
