### Saviour in Need

At 14th level, you can draw upon your inner strength to help an ally escape from nefarious effects.
As a bonus action, you can end one creative effect on yourself or a willing creature you touch.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your 1 + Charisma modifier (minimum of once) and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
