### Medical Expertise

You are particularly adept at healing the wounded. You have advantage on all Wisdom (Medicine) checks made to stabilize dying creatures, and if you roll a 20 on the ability check, the creature regains consciousness with 1 hit point. A creature can only benefit from this effect once and must finish a long rest before it can do so again.
You also gain Expertise in Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and whenever you craft medicines or poisons, it takes you half of the time and cost it normally would.
Additionally, when you stabilize a creature, you can remove one poison or disease from it.
