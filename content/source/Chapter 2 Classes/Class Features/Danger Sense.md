### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, allowing you to react to any source of danger.
You have advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and creations. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
In addition, while raging, if you see a creature within 5ft of you get hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to become the target of that attack instead.
