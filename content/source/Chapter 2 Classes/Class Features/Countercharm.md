### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As a reaction to a creature failing an effect that would leave them charmed or frightened, you can make them succeed instead. A creature must be within 60ft range of yourself and able to hear you to gain this benefit.
At 13th level, you gain the ability to protect multiple people from mind-influencing effects. When you use this ability, you can instead target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier.
