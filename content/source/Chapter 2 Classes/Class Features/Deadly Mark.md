### Deadly Mark

Beginning at 18th level, your knowledge of your mark and hunting prowess have both expanded greatly, making each and every shot against your prey both deadly and efficient.
The additional damage you deal to the creature marked by your Favored Mark feature applies to all of your weapon attacks against them instead of once per turn.
