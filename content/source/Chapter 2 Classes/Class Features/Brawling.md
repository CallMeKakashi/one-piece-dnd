### Brawling

At 1st Level, your experience in street fighting gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and brawler weapons, which are improvised weapons and any simple melee weapons⁠ that lacks the two-handed or heavy property.
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only brawler weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:
* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and brawler weapons.
* You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or brawler weapon. This die changes as you gain brawler levels, as shown in the Brawling column of the Brawler table.
* When you hit with an unarmed strike, improvised weapon, or brawler weapon, you can choose to make the damage type of the attack bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
