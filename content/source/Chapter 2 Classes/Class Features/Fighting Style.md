### Fighting Style

At 2nd Level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the options from Chapter 5 in the Savant Styles section.
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to savants.
