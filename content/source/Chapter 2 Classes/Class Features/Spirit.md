### Spirit

Starting at 2nd Level, your training allows you to draw upon an inner energy of willpower and grit. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of spirit points. Your brawler level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Spirit Points column of the Brawler table.
You can spend these points to fuel various spirit features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Deft Escape. You learn more spirit features as you gain levels in this class.
When you spend a spirit point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you psyche your spirit back to full energy.
Some of your spirit features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
**Spirit save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier
#### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 spirit point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
#### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 spirit point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
#### Deft Escape
While you are grappled, you can spend 1 spirit point to attempt to escape a grapple or restraints as a bonus action.
