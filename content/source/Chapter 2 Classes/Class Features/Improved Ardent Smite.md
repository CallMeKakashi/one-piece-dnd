### Improved Ardent Smite

Starting at 11th level, your power will suffuses your entire being, causing every attack you make to carry elemental powers behind them.
Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage of the type you chose for your Ardent Soul, as described in the Ardent Soul Element table.
