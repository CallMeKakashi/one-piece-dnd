### Brute

The powerful Brute focuses on the use of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows, and to take heavy hits.
#### Brute Force
Starting at 3rd level, whenever you hit with a weapon that you’re proficient with and deal damage, the weapon’s damage increases by 1d4. This feature also works with unarmed strikes. This bonus becomes 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.
#### Unstoppable Durability
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you make a saving throw, roll 1d6 and add the die to your saving throw total. If applying this bonus to a death saving throw increases the total to 20 or higher, you gain the benefits of rolling a 20 on the d20.

At 10th level, you won't give up the fight. When you use your Second Wind feature, you additionally gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount you rolled.
#### Devastating Critical
Starting at 15th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your level in this class.
#### Survivor
At 18th level, at the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
