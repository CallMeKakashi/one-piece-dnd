The inventive Arms Dealer devotes their fighting style to crafting creative ammunition to create a well equipped arsenal. Arms Dealer are able to use a balance of not only craft their shots, but also their keen skills with ranged combat to defeat even the most powerful foes.
#### Engineering

Once per turn when you fire a piece of ammo from a ranged weapon as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Advanced Arsenal options to that piece of ammo. You decide to use the option when the ammo hits, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. If an option requires a saving throw, your Advanced Arsenal save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
You have a number uses of this ability equal to 1 + your Intelligence Modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
