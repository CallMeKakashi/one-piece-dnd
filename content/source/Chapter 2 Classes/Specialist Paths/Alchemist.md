### Alchemist

An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce chemical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away. Its versatility has long been valued during times of war and peace.
#### Periodic Proficiency
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
In addition, you can choose to prepare creations and tricks from the Medic creation list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the creation, and it becomes a Gadgeteer creation for you.
When you gain the High Tech Development feature at 11th level and so on, you may also choose Medic creations for that ability.
#### Alchemist Creations
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain creations prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Creations table. These creations count as gadgeteer creations for you, but they don't count against the number of gadgeteer creations you prepare.

| Gadgeteer Level | Alchemist Creations |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd  | Healing Word, Bless |
| 5th  | Hold Person, Acid Arrow |
| 9th | Beacon of Hope, Mass Healing Word |
| 13th | Blight, Death Ward |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Raise Dead  |
#### Chemical Cocktail
Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can quickly produce a chemical cocktail in an empty flask you touch. Choose from the Chemical Cocktail table for the cocktail's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks it. As a bonus action, a creature can drink it or administer it to an incapacitated creature.
You can create additional chemical cocktails by expending a creation slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the cocktail in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the cocktail's effect from the Chemical Cocktail table.
Creating a Chemical Cocktail requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any cocktail you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.
When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more cocktails at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Each one requires its own flask.
##### Chemical Cocktails
| Effect |
|:----|
| Healing. The Drinker regains hit points equal to 4d4 + Your Intelligence Modifier |
| Swiftness. The drinker's walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour. |
| Resilience. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes. |
| Boldness. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute. |
| Strength. The drinker, for 1 minute, deals extra damage with Melee attacks equal to your Intelligence Modifier |
| Transformation. The drinker's body is transformed as if by the Alter Self creation. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the creation, the effects of which last for 10 minutes.  |
#### Alchemical Savant
At 5th level, you've developed a masterful command over chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you use a creation using your alchemist's supplies as the creation focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the creation. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
#### Restorative Agents
Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:
- Whenever a creature drinks a Chemical Cocktail you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- You can use the Lesser Restoration creation without expending a creation slot and without preparing the creation, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the creation focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
#### Chemical Mastery
By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:
- You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.
- You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a creation slot, without preparing the creation, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the creation focus. Once you cast either creation with this feature three times, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest.
