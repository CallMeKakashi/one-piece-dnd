### Elementalist

Elementalists are gadgeteers who stick to what they know, typically relying on a single modified weapon or tool for protection. This weapon is elemental in nature and can be quite potent. Their creations and techniques usually center around this special device.
#### Gadget Weapon
At 3rd level, you create a gadgeteer weapon that acts as a container for your creations.
Over the course of 1 hour, you can use your tinker's tools to modify one simple or martial weapon into a specialist weapon. You are proficient in the use of your gadgeteer weapon, and it gains the following benefits.
* You can use your Intelligence score, rather than Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls with the specialist weapon.
* The specialist weapon counts as an apparatus for your gadgeteer creations.
* The damage type becomes your choice of acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder, or the weapon's original damage. You can change the weapon's damage type when you finish a short or long rest.
* If the weapon normally requires ammunition to be used, it now produces its own ammunition.
* If the weapon has the thrown property, it returns to your hand after being thrown.
You can only have one gadget weapon at any time. If you create a new gadget weapon, the old one immediately ceases to function and becomes a normal weapon again.
#### Elementalist Creations
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain creations prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Elementalist Creations table. These creations count as gadgeteer creations for you, but they don't count against the number of gadgeteer creations you prepare.
| Gadgeteer Level | Elementalist Creations |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd  | Fog Cloud, Advanced Weapon |
| 5th  | Scorch, Mirror Image |
| 9th | Lightning Bolt, Fireball |
| 13th | Stormy Sphere, Ardent Shield |
| 17th | Cloudkill, Cone of Cold  |
#### Creation Recovery
Beggining at level 3, you have learned to refuel your creations by tinkering with your apparatus.
Once per long rest, when you finish a short rest, you can choose a number of expended Creation Slots to recover. The Creation Slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Gadgeteer level (rounded up).
#### Battle Gadgeteer
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with your specialist weapon. You can use a trick in place of one of these attacks.
If you ready your action to make an attack, you can attack the same number of times you would if you had taken the attack action on your turn.
In addition, you learn 1 additional trick from the Gadgeteer Creation list.
#### Elemental Empowerment
Beginning at 9th level, you exert fine control over the potent elemental energy of your weapon. When you deal damage with your Gadget Weapon or with your Gadget Weapon, you gain a 1d8 bonus to that damage roll.
In addition, when you activate an evocation creation that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the creation's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the creation, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
#### Up To Eleven
Starting at 15th level, you can increase the power of your elemental creations to devasting degrees while holding your Gadget Weapon. When you cast a Gadgeteer creation of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that creation.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the creation, immediately after you activate it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per creation level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
