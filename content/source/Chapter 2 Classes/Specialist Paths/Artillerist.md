### Artillerist

An Artillerist specializes in using their gadgets and creations to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many islands.
#### Tool Proficiencies
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
#### Artillerist Creations
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain creations prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Creations table. These creations count as gadgeteer creations for you, but they don't count against the number of gadgeteer creations you prepare.
##### Artillerist Creations
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain creations prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Creations table. These creations count as gadgeteer creations for you, but they don't count against the number of gadgeteer creations you prepare.
| Gadgeteer Level | Artillerist Creations |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd  | Shield, Thunderwave |
| 5th  | Scorch, Shatter |
| 9th | Fireball, Wind Wall |
| 13th | Sickening Radiance, Wall of Fire |
| 17th | Cone Of Cold, Wall Of Force  |
#### Mechanical Cannon
Also at 3rd level, you've learned how to create a mechanical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to create a Small or Tiny mechanical cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small mechanical cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a creation slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.
Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your gadgeteer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending creation is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.
When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Mechanical Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.
##### Mechanical Cannons
| Cannon Type | Activation |
|:---------:|:-------------|
| Elemental Culverin  | The cannon exhales energy in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your creation save DC, taking 3d8 damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type can be your choice of fire, cold, lightning, acid, thunder, or poison. |
| Force Ballista  | Make a ranged creation attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon. |
| Protector | The cannon emits a burst of energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 20 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). |
#### Mechanical Firearm
At 5th level, You know how to turn a mundane object into a Mechanical Firearm, a conduit for your destructive creations. When you finish a long rest, you can use your tools to turn it into your Mechanical Firearm. This lasts indefinitely, until you make another one.
You can use your Mechanical Firearm as a creation focus for your gadgeteer creations. When you cast a gadgeteer creation through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the creation's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.
#### Explosive Cannon
Starting at 9th level, every Mechanical Cannon you create is more destructive:
- The cannon's damage and temporary hit point rolls all increase by 1d8.
- As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your creation save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### Fortified Position
By 15th level, you’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Mechanical Cannon:
- You and your allies gain a +2 bonus to their AC and Dex Saves. while within 10 feet of the cannon you create with Mechanical Cannon.
- You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same creation slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.
