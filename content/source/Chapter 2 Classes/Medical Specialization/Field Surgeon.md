### Field Surgeon

Field surgeons are the archetypical pirate crew doctors, who wade into the fray with their allies without fear. To this end, they're the most adept at using experimental medicine in combat and have found ways to improve its potency manifold. However, this power comes at a cost to their humanity if they go too far with it, and most field surgeons hesitate to indulge in their most powerful medicine too often for this reason.
#### Combat Medicine
Beginning at 2nd level, you can now use Experimental Medicine as a bonus action rather than an action and can swap between enhancements as a bonus action as well.
Additionally, the temporary hit points you gain from Experimental Medicine now includes your Wisdom modifier.
Furthermore, you gain a natural armor equal to 10 + your Wisdom Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. This natural armor does not benefit from shields, and you cannot benefit from any worn armor.
#### Enhanced Forms
Also at 2nd level, the enhancements provided by Experimental Medicine become stronger for you.
* **Hulking Strength.** The damage die of your unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks increases to 1d10.
* **Nimble Dexterity.** Opportunity attacks against you now have disadvantage.
* **Resilient Constitution.** You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.
If you ready your action to make an attack, you can attack the same number of times you would if you had taken the attack action on your turn.
#### Monstrous Transformation
Also at 6th level, you can cast aside common sense and use the full strength of your medicine to transform into a monster. As a bonus action on your turn, transform into a monstrous form of yourself. This transformation follows the same rules as your standard Experimental Medicine transformations. During this transformation, you gain the following benefits:
* Your size becomes large, and your creature type becomes monstrosity.
* The temporary hit points you gain are doubled.
* Your unarmed strikes gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up).
* You gain the benefits of all three enhancements available to Experimental Medicine simultaneously.
During this transformation, you cannot use creations. At the start of each of your turns, you must make an Intelligence saving throw, DC 15. On a success, you can act as normal.
On a failure, you lose control until the start of your next turn. You must move towards the closest creature within range and take the Attack action against it.
If no creature is within range, you can take the Dash action to move towards the nearest creature. If you are unable to move or take actions and this is caused by an effect that can be ended with an action, you can then take an action to attempt to end the effect on yourself.
Once this transformation ends, you gain one level of exhaustion and cannot transform like this again until you finish a long rest.
#### Contained Rampage
Beginning at 10th level, you no longer need to make the Intelligence save to regain control during Monstrous Transformation and can move and act normally, however you still cannot use creations in this state and still suffer a level of exhaustion once it ends.
#### Greater Enhancements
Starting at 14th level, you've mastered the formula for your Experimental Medicine, enhancing the effects of it even further.
* **Hulking Strength.** The damage die of your unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks increases to 1d12, and you now have advantage on all Strength checks and saving throws.
* **Nimble Dexterity.** Your speed doubles and creatures cannot make opportunity attacks against you.
* **Resilient Constitution.** You gain immunity to the paralyzed, stunned, and poisoned conditions, and resistance to poison and necrotic damage.
Additionally, you can now use creations in your Monstrous Transformation as you have mastered the transformation completely.
