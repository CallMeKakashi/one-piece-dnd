### Bio-Engineer

The Bio-Engineer is a medic that toys with life, playing god. Performing experiments and tests that result in the creation of a whole new being, their test subject, a companion through each phase of experimentation. Medics of this study are often either praised, ridiculed, or even feared for their work.
#### Test Subject
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you create a test subject that will follow your every whim.
Choose either the Amalgamation, Flora, or Clone to be your test subject, all listed at the end of the subclass description. Your test takes a form appropriate to its type, for instance, an Amalgamation might be made up of several animals, and a Clone could be a genetically modified human.
In combat, the test subjects acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action.
If your test subject is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious and makes death saving throws as normal instead of dying outright. As an action, you can touch an unconscious or dead test subject and expend one creation slot of 1st level or higher. If your test subject was unconscious, it regains 1d8 hit points per creation slot level instantly. If your test subject was dead, it regains consciousness after 1 minute with all its maximum hit points restored.
Your test subject always knows the general direction of your position and will immediately seek you out to the best of its ability if the two of you are separated.
#### Experimental Augmentations
Also at 2nd level, you can further customize your Test Subject with a number of upgrades equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can change these Experimental Augmentations at the end of a long rest.

* When you use a creation with a range of self, you can choose to have the creation affect both yourself and your Test Subject.
* Your Test Subject shares any Haki features that you have.

In addition, your Test Subject gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

At 14th level, you have perfected the art of engineering living organisms. You gain the following benefits:
