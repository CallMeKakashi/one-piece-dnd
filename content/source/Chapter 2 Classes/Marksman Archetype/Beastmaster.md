### Beastmaster

Beastmasters are wardens of nature and skilled survivalists. They have an innate ability to communicate with animals and are always accompanied by a bestial companion that fights alongside them as an extension of the beastmaster's own body.
#### Beastmaster Creations
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the following bonus creations at specific marksman levels. They count as marksman creations for you, but doesn't count towards the number of marksman creations you car prepare.
| Marksman Level | Creation |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd | Animal Friend, Purify Food and Drink (R) |
| 5th | Call Beast, Spider Walk |
| 9th | Beastial Transformation, Blooming Jam |
| 13th | Dominate Beast, Hideout |
| 17th | Awaken, Sense Territory (R) |
#### Bestial Companion
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you get access to an animal companion that will follow you on your adventures.
Choose either the Beast of the Air, Beast of the Earth, or Beast of the Sea to be your companion, all listed at the end of the subclass description. Your bestial companion takes a form appropriate to its type, for instance, a Beast of the Air might be a hawk, and Beast of the Land could be a bear.
In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
If your bestial companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious and makes death saving throws as normal instead of dying outright. As an action, you can touch an unconscious or dead bestial companion and expend one creation slot of 1st level or higher. If your bestial companion was unconscious, it regains 1d8 hit points per creation slot level instantly. If your bestial companion was dead, it regains consciousness after 1 minute with all its maximum hit points restored.
While traveling alone with your bestial companion, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. Your bestial companion always knows the general direction of your position and will immediately seek you out to the best of its ability if the two of you are separated.
#### Natural Attunement
Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill if you don't already have it and may double your proficiency bonus for any ability check made with the skill.
Additionally, you can speak and communicate with beasts and understand anything they are saying. This doesn't make them any friendlier towards you than normal, however, you can combine this ability with food to curry favor with animals.
#### Exceptional Training
Beginning at 7th level, you've trained your companion well.
Your bestial companion can take the Dash, Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on its turn. In addition, if you know any Haki abilities, your bestial companion gains those abilities as well.
#### Bestial Fury
At 11th level, your bestial companion grows more adept at combat. Your bestial companion can now make two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action.
#### Enrage
At 15th level, you and your bestial companion become enraged with primal fury at the sight of injury to each other.
When your bestial companion is reduced to 0 hit points, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your bestial companion gains these benefits instead.
* You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You gain immunity to the charmed, frightened, and paralyzed conditions, and your movement speed cannot be reduced.
* When you take the Attack action, on your turn, you can make one additional weapon attack.
You and your bestial companion can gain these benefits once each, and regain the ability to gain them after you finish a long rest.
