## Marksman Archetype

Marksmen are all defined by their improbable aim and massive resourcefulness that sets them apart from common gunmen. However, marksmen differ greatly from each other, some being patient snipers that take down enemies from afar, while others tame beasts that aid them in taking out enemies, and others still learn how to wield melee weapons as skillfully as they wield their guns and bows.
