### Radiant Superiority

Savants are a special breed, and this is something a few of them realize early. Fueled by their own pride and feelings of superiority, some savants can harness a blazing light at their beck and call. Almost regal in their appearance, these savants can be anything from noble defenders to vain tyrants.
#### Shining Soul
Beginning when you unlock this ardent soul at 1st level, you gain resistance to radiant damage. You also learn the Light and Radiant Bolt trick if you don't already know it.
#### Ardent Creations
You gain the following ardent creations at specific savant levels. They count as savant creations for you, and you always have these creations prepared, though they do not count towards the number of creations you can prepare.
##### Ardent Creations
| Savant Level | Creation |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2nd | Fairy Lights, Beacon |
| 5th | Branding Smite, Grounding |
| 9th | Crusader's Aura, Blinding Smite |
| 13th | Sickening Radiance, Sunburn |
| 17th | Gamma Knife, Wall of Light |
#### Channel Conviction
At 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Conviction options.
***Blazing Light.*** As a bonus action, you can manifest the element of your soul around a weapon. A limb used for unarmed strikes is a viable option. For 1 minute, your weapon sheds bright light in a 20 feet radius and dim light for another 20 feet, and you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to the attack rolls you make with the weapon.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
***Commanding Presence.*** You can use your Channel Conviction to exude a presence of majesty. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed or frightened of you for 1 minute (your choice). You choose the same condition for each creature. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
#### Aura of Elegance
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cannot be knocked prone or moved against your will while you are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Blinding Flare
Beginning at 15th level, you can blind enemies when you strike them with radiant energies.
When you deal radiant damage to a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your creation save DC. On a failed save, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of once) and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
#### Absolute Authority
At 20th level, you can wreathe yourself in light to become a being of perfection. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You have immunity to radiant damage and resistance against all other forms of damage.
* Once when you miss with a weapon or creation attack on your turn, you can reroll the attack and must use the new roll.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level creation slot to use it again.
