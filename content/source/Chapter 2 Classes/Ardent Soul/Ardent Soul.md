## Ardent Soul

A savant is defined by their innate ability to draw upon a fantastical elemental force. Sometimes, it is a gift that they are born with, such as oracles that can scry the future. Other times, it is a result of genetic tampering in an attempt to create super soldiers. More rarely is it that a savant awakens their ability on the seas, as a result of a strong conviction.
Savants are typically colored by the type of gift that they've been granted, though this isn't necessarily good or bad. Fire and heat, for instance, tend to represent passion, so a valiant protector of the weak and an ambitious, ruthless conqueror could both end up drawing on this power.
