### Necrotic Mania

Savants who go off the deep end; who lose themselves to negative emotions of obsession, despondency and hate, sometimes find their powers change with their mental state. A degenerative energy surrounds them, which destroys everything they touch. While not all these savants are evil, it becomes all too easy for them to lose track of what they once cherished, replaced only by a relentless obsession with achieving their ambitions and destroying their enemies.
#### Scornful Soul
Beginning when you unlock this ardent soul at 1st level, you gain resistance to necrotic damage. You also learn the Necrotic Bolt and Chilling Necrosis trick if you don't already know them.
#### Ardent Creations
You gain the following ardent creations at specific savant levels. They count as savant creations for you, and you always have these creations prepared, though they do not count towards the number of creations you can prepare.
##### Ardent Creations
| Savant Level | Creation |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2nd | Hex, Karma |
| 5th | Woebegone, Enfeeblement |
| 9th | Fear, Animate Dead |
| 13th | Blight, Kill Radius |
| 17th | Life Steal, Necrosis Surge |
#### Channel Conviction
At 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Conviction options.
***Consuming Gloom.*** As a bonus action, you can manifest the element of your soul around a weapon. A limb used for unarmed strikes is a viable option. For 1 minute, all bright light within 20 feet of the weapon becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness, and you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to the attack rolls you make with the weapon. Additionally, you can see normally in all forms of darkness for the duration.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
***Feed on Despair.*** As an action, you can gorge yourself on the suffering and pain of your enemies. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw, taking 2d10 + your Savant level + you Charisma modifier necrotic damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. You then gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt to one of these creatures.
#### Aura of Cruelty
Beginning at 7th level, you become surrounded by negative energy. While you are conscious, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you cannot regain hit points, and when a creature dies within this aura, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Merciless Fiend
Starting at 15th level, your hate filled soul gives you a hellish level of endurance. You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your savant level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren’t incapacitated.
#### Creature of Scorn
Starting at 20th level, you can completely give in to the darkness within your heart and transform into a fiendish creature of hate. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* Your attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
* You have advantage on weapon attacks against creatures that are missing any of their hit points.
* Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can choose to gain an equal number of temporary hit points, which last until the start of your next turn.
Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level creation slot to use it again.
