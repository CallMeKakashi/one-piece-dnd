### Fulminating Glee

Savants who have little care for anything but fun in the world tend to be sparking with energy, which appears as jolts of lightning shooting from their bodies. At their best, they are bundles of infectious joy. At their worst, they are arrogant bullies who care only for their enjoyment.
#### Sparking Soul
Beginning when you unlock this ardent soul at 1st level, you gain resistance to lightning damage. You also learn the Shocking Grasp and Spark Bolt tricks if you don't already know them.
#### Ardent Creations
You gain the following ardent creations at specific savant levels. They count as savant creations for you, and you always have these creations prepared, though they do not count towards the number of creations you can prepare.
##### Ardent Creations
| Savant Level | Creation |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2nd | Twist Fate, Zapping Arc |
| 5th | Blur, Misty Step |
| 9th | Lightning Arrow, Lightning Bolt |
| 13th | Freedom of Movement, Storm Sphere |
| 17th | Far Step, Steel Wind Strike |
#### Channel Conviction
At 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Conviction options.
***Manifest Soul.*** As a bonus action, you can manifest the element of your soul around a weapon. A limb used for unarmed strikes is a viable option. For 1 minute, your weapon attacks and creations that deal lightning damage can spread through enemies, as you have the choice to give them a damage spread of 5ft, DC spell save.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
***Schadenfreude.*** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Conviction to begin a mocking tirade at a creature. The creature then has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you for 1 minute. For 1 minute, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to target a different creature with this feature, and when you do so this effect ends on the original creature.
#### Aura of Freedom
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or restrained, and ignore difficult terrain, while you are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Lightning Reflexes
Beginning at 15th level, you can take advantage of an enemy's mistake in the flash of an eye.
When a creature misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to instantly make an opportunity attack against it.
#### Rider of Storms
At 20th level, you can channel the storm to surround yourself with thunder and lightning. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You are immune to lightning damage.
* You have a flying speed of 60 feet, and when you use this flying speed, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level creation slot to use it again.
