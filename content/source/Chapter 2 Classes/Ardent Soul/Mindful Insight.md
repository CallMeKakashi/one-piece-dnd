### Mindful Insight

These savants differ from others in that their emotional state doesn't manifest as vigorously as it does for others. Instead, these savants have been blessed with the arts of premonition, able to scry the future through crystal balls or tarot cards, and they are sometimes referred to as "oracles".
#### Psychic Soul
Beginning when you unlock this ardent soul at 1st level, you gain resistance to psychic damage. You also learn the Whisper and Mind Slash tricks if you don't already know them.
#### Ardent Creations
You gain the following ardent creations at specific savant levels. They count as savant creations for you, and you always have these creations prepared, though they do not count towards the number of creations you can prepare.
##### Ardent Creations
| Savant Level | Creation |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2nd | Discordant Tune, Identification |
| 5th | Augury, Truth Zone |
| 9th | Clairvoyance, Sending |
| 13th | Divination, Locate Creature |
| 17th | Scrying, Legend Lore |
#### Channel Conviction
At 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Conviction options.
***Future's Ward.*** As a reaction when an ally is the target of an attack or is forced to roll a saving throw, you can use your Channel Conviction to peer into the future for the best course of action. You can impose disadvantage on the attack roll, or grant the ally advantage on the saving throw. If you impose disadvantage, the target must additionally subtract your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) from its roll. If you grant advantage, the ally may add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to its roll.
***Powerful Premonition.*** As a bonus action, you can empower your psychic prowess. For 1 minute, you can use your bonus action, and the bonus action used to activate this feature, to use the Mind Slash trick.
#### Aura of Warding
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to the damage of creations while you are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Exposing Smite
Beginning at 15th level, when you deal damage to a creature with Ardent Smite, you scry its mind for weaknesses. The next attack made against the target by a creature other than you then has advantage.
#### Fateweaver
At 20th level, you can ascend to a higher state of mind. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You are immune to psychic damage.
* Attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on all saving throws.
* Immediately when you activate this feature, roll two d20, called fate dice, and record the rolls. At any point before the transformation ends, you can replace any d20 roll made by a creature you can see with one of these fate dice. You can only do this once per turn, and any unused fate dice disappear at the end of the transformation.
Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level creation slot to use it again.
