### Cold Indifference

Savants whose hearts are distant from the world, who keep their feelings shut away from others, may manifest the icy cold embrace of winter around them. Those who break past their icy shells will find stout allies who can approach any problem with a level head and cool rationality.
#### Frozen Soul
Beginning when you unlock this ardent soul at 1st level, you gain resistance to cold damage and can tolerate temperatures as cold as negative 50 degrees without additional protection. Lastly, you gain the Ice Bolt and Piercing Frost tricks.
#### Ardent Creations
You gain the following ardent creations at specific savant levels. They count as savant creations for you, and you always have these creations prepared, though they do not count towards the number of creations you can prepare.
##### Ardent Creations
| Savant Level | Creation |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2nd | Cause Strife, Ice Dagger |
| 5th | Hold Person, Ice Lock |
| 9th | Ice Storm, Slow |
| 13th | Control Water, Hold Monster |
| 17th | Cone of Cold, Wall of Ice |
#### Channel Conviction
At 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Conviction options.
***Manifest Soul.*** As a bonus action, you can manifest the element of your soul around a weapon. A limb used for unarmed strikes is a viable option. For 1 minute, your weapon attacks that deal cold damage reduces the target's AC by 2, and halves their speed. This effect doesn't stack. The target can spend their action to end the effect, or if another creature spends their action to also end the effect.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
***Touch of Winter.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Conviction to instantly freeze the surrounding area. The area within 20 feet of you becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than you as jagged ice spreads across it. If you touch a body of water, you instantly freeze the surface and as deep as 10 feet of the water. Any creature occupying this space is pushed to the nearest unfrozen square. The ice remains for 1 minute until it thaws.
#### Aura of Winter
Starting at 7th level, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you has their speed reduced by 10 while you are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Bitter Chill
Beginning at 15th level, your creations grasp enemies in the cold throes of winter.
While a creature is under the effects of a creation you have used that either reduces its speed or incapacitates it, it suffers cold damage at the start of its turn equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). If damage would normally allow the creature to make a saving throw, this damage does not trigger such effects.
#### Diamond Dust
At 20th level, you can manifest your inner cold in a veil of frost and snow. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You are immune to cold damage.
* Creatures within range of your Aura of Winter or Touch of Winter now suffer damage from Bitter Chill as if it was a creation, and the damage of Bitter Chill is doubled.
* Creatures that move into or start their turn in your Aura of Winter or Touch of Winter must make a Strength saving throw against your creation save DC. On a failed save, the creature's speed is 0 until the end of your next turn.
Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level creation slot to use it again.
