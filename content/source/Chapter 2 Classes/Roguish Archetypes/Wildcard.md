### Wildcard

Lady Luck is a strange mistress, willing to give and take as she pleases, making even the most unlikely events a stark possibility. Rogues that fall under this archetype are masters of treading the lines of fortune and misery.
These masters of gambling are able to utilize their skills in combat, and stay calm under pressure as the world around them succumbs to pandemonium. As they continue, they may even be able to influence the chaos to a noticable degree.
#### Master Dealer
Starting at 3rd level, you have been trained in many types of games. You gain proficiency in 3 types of gaming sets of your choice, one of which you can have expertise in.
In addition, you gain proficiency with improvised weapons and can utilize parts of gaming sets you are proficient in as improivsed weapons, such as using cards.
Improvised weapons you wield have the finesse and thrown (30/120) properties. They deal 1d6 damage, which increases to 1d8 at 6th, 1d10 at 11th, and 1d12 at 16th level. Their damage type is your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
#### Risky Gambit
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to notice that chaos seems to follow you everywhere you go, typically forming as an unexpected surge of events that you can take full advantage of whenever an opportunity presents itself.
One per turn, as a bonus action, you can roll a 1d100, the result of which determines an effect that will occur as described on the Risky Gambit table. If that effect is a creation, or requires a saving throw, the DC = 8 + Your Dexterity modifier + Your proficiency bonus. If it requires concentration, you must maintain concentration on it.
#### Willy-Nilly
Starting at 6th level, chaos continues to follow you as lady luck looms over head, its time for you to throw out any and all random abilities you got. The following effects are added to your Devious Strike options.
**Volatile (Cost: 1d6).** Your attack suddenly is infused with a dangerous element. Roll 1d6. The result determines the damage type of your sneak attack, as shown on the table below.
##### Volatile Damage
| Number | Damage Type |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | Acid |
| 2  | Cold |
| 3 | Fire |
| 4 | Lightning |
| 5 | Poison |
| 6 | Thunder |
**Quick Draw (Cost: 1d6).** Like drawing a card, you quickly influence the odds with a mere gesture. As part of the attack, you can use your Risky Gambit feature. You can still only activate Risky Gambit once per turn.
#### Pokerface
At 9th level, you can keep calm even while under pressure. You gain advantage on any Charisma (Deception) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
#### Double Down
Starting at 13th level, you can choose to double down on your risky gambit, becoming well prepared for what comes your way. Whenever you roll on the Risky Gambit table, you can roll twice and you choose which one takes effect.
Alternatively, you can choose to take both of the results at the same time. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a short or long rest.
#### Fate's Design
Starting at 17th level, either through sheer prepartion or dumb luck, you find yourself able to avoid nearly any deadly scenario.
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make any saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
