### Path of the Channeler

Barbarians the tread the Path of the Channeler draw from within themselves the inner strength that lies with all of mankind, the power to destroy one's limits and defy kings, your very strikes causing shockwaves across the battlefield.
Through their rage, they can move mountains with their unbelievable physical power, and achieve might on par with that of a giant's.
#### Channel Destruction
When you choose this path, your attacks gain the siege property, dealing double damage to objects and structures. Additionally, you learn either the Natural Arts or Show Off trick (your choice). Wisdom is your creative ability for this trick.
#### Gigantic Might
When you choose this path, at 3rd level, you learn how to channel your inner might to grow both in size and power to become a force of destruction. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
* Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn’t enough room for you to increase your size, your size doesn’t change.
* Your melee weapon attacks and thrown weapon attacks deal an additional 1d4 thunder damage.
* When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you unleash a powerful shockwave on impact. All creatures of your choice within 5ft of the target takes thunder damage equal to your level.
#### Move Mountains
At 6th level, your titanic might now allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield.
As a bonus action while raging, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within a range of 10 x your proficiency bonus feet of yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.
If at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn’t on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing prone.
#### Titan Monger
At 10th level, your strikes can tear any foe asunder and throw even the largest beasts as if they were a tiny stone. The shockwave from your Gigantic Might feature now damages creatures of your choice within 10ft, and halves their movement speed until the end of their next turn.
In addition, you can now use your Move Mountains to move creatures that are Large or smaller.
#### Colossal Channeler
When you reach 14th level, you shatter your limits once more. You gain the following benefits while raging:
* Your reach increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Large or Huge (your choice).
* Your melee weapon attacks and thrown weapon attacks deal an additional 2d4 thunder damage instead of 1d4.
* Your weapon attacks gain a damage spread of 5ft, the DC being calculated as 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. If the attack was a critical hit, the damage spread increases to 15ft.
