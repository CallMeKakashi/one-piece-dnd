### Path of the Blade Master

The rage of a blade master is not the mad screams of a berserker or the primal howls of a totem warrior, but a silent, merciless and deadly intent that suffuses their blades like an aura. Blade masters draw on their rage like other barbarians, but they wield it like another blade rather than give in to it, unleashing the full power of their fury without losing sight of their goal.
While swords are the most popular weapon for these barbarians, they are not restricted to such weapons alone. The philosophy behind their power can be applied to any melee weapon of their choice.
#### Fighting Style
Starting when you chose this path at 3rd level, you learn how to properly wield your weapon of choice. Choose a fighting style from the Chapter 5 in the Blademaster Barbarian Styles section. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to Blademaster Barbarians.
#### Masterful Hew
Also at 3rd level, you learn special techniques that leverage your mastery of martial combat mixed with your primal strength. Once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack, you can perform a special attack called a hew, choosing from the list below.
At 10th level, each of the hew options improve as per their description.
##### Cleaving Hew
Each other creature other than yourself within 5 feet of it suffers damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is the same type as the weapon used for the attack. If you are raging when you perform this hew, you add your rage damage bonus to this damage.
At 10th level, while raging, the range of the cleave increases to each creature within 10ft, other than yourself.
##### Crushing Hew
You can additionally make a grapple or shove attack against it as part of the same attack. If you are raging when you perform this hew, you count as one size larger for the purpose of this grapple or shove.
At 10th level, while raging, when you successfully grapple or shove a creature with this hew, you deal your rage damage modifier to the creature.
##### Savage Hew
You can roll damage for the attack twice and choose the higher number. If you were raging when you perform this hew, you double your rage damage bonus to this attack.
At 10th level, while raging, you gain a bonus to the damage roll of the attack equal to half your level (rounded down).
##### Sprinting Hew
You can move up to half your speed, either before or after making the attack. If you were raging when you perform this hew, your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
At 10th level, while raging, you can move up to your full movement speed instead of up to half.
#### Steel Rending
Also at 6th level, your focused fury is honed like an edge, allowing you to pierce through any defenses.
While raging, your weapon attacks ignore any resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and your weapon attacks gain the Siege property, dealing double damage to structures and buildings.
#### Tempered Rage
Beginning at 6th level, constant wrestling with your rage and fury has made you fully in control of your emotions. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you're already proficient, you gain proficiency in your choice of Intelligence or Charisma saving throws.
#### Proof of Mettle
Beginning at 10th level, you can make a statement when you deal a killing blow to a creature. While raging and you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, you can release a surge of fear around you. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you for 1 minute or until it can no longer see you. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.
You can use this feature only once per rage.
#### Inexorable Prowess
Beginning at 14th level, you never have disadvantage on weapon attacks against creatures you can see while you are raging.
