### College of Lore

Bards of the college of lore know something about most things. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.
The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of the state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.
#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
#### Cutting Words
Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you.
#### Additional Musical Secrets
At 6th level, you learn two creations of your choice from any class. A creation you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a trick. The chosen creations count as bard creations for you but don’t count against the number of bard creations you know.
#### Customized Creativity
Also at 6th level, you gain the ability alter your creations to thanks to your mastery knowledge from all over the world. You gain two of the following Customized Creativity options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 14th level.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and each option only takes a single use. You regain all uses of this ability at the end of a long rest.
* **Failsafe.** When you use a creation that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the creations' full effects. Choose a number of those creatures up to your creativity modifier (minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the creation, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
* **Extended Range.** When you use a creation that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can instead double the range of the creation. When you use a creation that has a range of touch, you can instead make the range of the creation 30 feet.
* **Quick Creation.** When you use a creation that has a creation time of 1 action, you can change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this usage.
* **Silenced.** When you use a creation, you can use it without any somatic or verbal components.
* **Alternative Effects.** When you use a creation that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder.
* **Double Trouble.** When you use a creation that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can target a second creature in range with the same creation. To be eligible, a creation must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the creation's current level. For example, the Missiles and Scorch creations aren't eligible, but Haste and Elemental Orb are.
#### Peerless Understanding
Starting at 14th level, your understanding of the gravity of your words allow you to leave all that hear them utterly befuddled.
When you use your Cutting Words feature on an enemy, that enemy has disadvantage on their next saving throw, or until you use this feature on another creature.
