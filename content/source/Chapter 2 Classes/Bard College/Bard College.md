## Bard College

The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions. A bard college is rarely a physical place, though such institutions do exist, but more often than not they are simply a collective term for bards that share similar philosophies and walks of life.
