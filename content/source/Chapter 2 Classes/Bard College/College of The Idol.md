### College of The Idol

Bards of the college of the idol harbor more ambition in their pursuit of their performance. These bards are most often regarded as superstars, and world-renouned idols, dazzling and capturing the hearts and minds of the audience all around the world.

When you join the College of The Idol at 3rd level, you can use your performance to cover for your allies. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction perform, allowing them to push forward. Make a Charisma (Performance) check and replace the original attack roll or ability check with the result, unless if the original was higher.
You have a number of uses of this ability equal to 1 + your Charisma Modifier. All these uses replenish on a long rest.

These temporary hit points last until the creature leaves your aura.
