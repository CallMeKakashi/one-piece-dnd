# Chapter 4: Equipment & Items

Marketplaces exist on every island and in every city, carrying with them a wide variety of goods and sundries for the traveling adventurer. You will find fishmongers, farmers, clothes boutiques, weaponsmiths, and shipwrights in just about every major port city, while smaller hamlets might only have a single general store or blacksmith available.
Merchants and traders are vital for every pirate that intends to take to the sea. Not only do they require their ship to be seaworthy and capable of holding up to the storms of the Grand Line, but without a full larder and the necessary sea charts they'd be lucky to reach the next island. If they don't deal in trade, they still need there to be plentiful loot when they raid the towns.
