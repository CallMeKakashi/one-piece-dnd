### Ship Rooms

Each room on a ship has a purpose. Bedrooms provide the crew the essential sleep they need to complete daily tasks, the kitchen provides the tools a chef needs to feed the crew, the deckhands may need workshops to build new materials for the ship, and much, much more. A ship is not just a wehicle, but  home for your long and hard journies ahead.
Each room builts has its own unique benefit, such as making some aspects of the pirate life more easy, like training, navigating, and treating illnesses.
Building ship rooms take on the same process of making ship upgrades, each having a cost and time. The cost refers to how much materials have to be taken in order to build this ship, and the time refers to how long it would take to form said materials into a functional room.
Each room is repeatable, for example having multiple Bedrooms and Workshops, but know that their benefits don't stack. For example, having two Sick Bays doesn't give a creature a 2d4 bonus. Each room's benefits are self-contained.
> ##### Optional Rule: Custom Rooms
> Not every crew is the same, and neither is every ship. So it stands to reason that the rooms listed above may not reflect every room in a ship.
>
> In this case, players and their DM can work together to figure out the benefits of a particular room. Note that not all rooms needs extra benefits. For example, a broom closet. Unless there is some special function in that broom closet, it should not provide any extra benefits.
