### Damage and Repairs

Damage to a crew's ship on the seas is an eventuality. Rough seas will all tear away at your ship's hull and wear down the masts and sails. Mooring to repair and maintain your ship in between is imperative to keep it seaworthy.
Whenever a ship suffers damage, its hit point maximum is reduced by a number equal to half the damage it suffered. Any crewmate can attempt to make repairs to restore lost hit points to a ship, but only a shipwright can restore lost maximum hit points. If a ship's hit point maximum is reduced below half its normal value, the ship is irreparably damaged and not even a shipwright can restore it to its original hit points maximum.
A creature can spend anywhere from 1 to 8 hours doing repairs to a ship. For each hour a creature spends doing repairs, it can roll a DC 10 tool ability check with carpenter's tools, or an Intelligence (Engineering) or Strength (Athletics) ability check, but the DC is increased by 5. On a successful check, the ship regains 5 hit points, or twice that if the creature making the check is a shipwright. A shipwright also restores the ship's hit point maximum by an equal amount on a successful check.
If a ship is brought to 0 hit points, it begins taking in water. The ship can remain afloat for a number of minutes equal to 10 + half its damage threshold value before completely sinking. While the ship is still afloat, a creature can attempt to temporarily block the leakage with a DC 15 tool ability check with carpenter's tools, or a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) or Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the hole is temporarily fixed and the ship can stay afloat for an additional 10 minutes or until it takes damage again.
Each time the ship suffers damage while below 0 hit points, a new hole opens in the hull requiring one additional action to stop the ship from taking in water.
