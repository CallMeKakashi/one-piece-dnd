### Upgrading your Ship

Owning a ship is a mark of pride for any captain, however, to stand out on the seas one must make additions to it that help it stand out from the common ship.
A skilled shipwright can upgrade an existing ship with all manners of additions and modifications. Upgrades require a creative mind and are typically not a service provided by most common shipwrights, including larger companies.
When crafting an upgrade for a ship, you follow the same crafting rules as the ones for building a ship. You can only craft one upgrade at a time, and other crewmembers can help you with building a ship. To craft an upgrade for a ship, you must first have a proficiency bonus equal to the number listed in the Proficiency column of the Ship Upgrades table. Additionally, the ship must meet the requirements listed for the upgrade, as described in the Requirement column of the same table.
Some upgrades come with additional bonuses to the ship, ranging from increased storage to sudden acceleration.
***Activation.*** This upgrade is normally not in effect. Someone on the crew (typically the helmsman) must use an action to activate the upgrade.
***Burst of Speed.*** As an action, the current helmsman of the ship can activate the turbo. The helmsman chooses a number of fuel to expend, to a maximum of the remaining fuel in all the ship's fuel tanks. Upon activation, it moves the ship a number of feet in a straight line equal to the total amount of fuel expended.

***Dive.*** This upgrade creates a shell around the ship, allowing it to dive beneath the ocean's surface and travel along the ocean floor.
***Everlasting.*** This upgrade reinforces your ship to ignore the effects of the Siege Property, as well as gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing.
***Fish Tank.*** A fish tank allows the crew to keep fresh fish on board, which can be used for food. This halves the crew's lifestyle expenses if they have a cook on board.
***Fuel Supply.*** A fuel supply is measured in gallons of fuel. Fuel supply by itself does nothing, however, it is necessary to use other specific upgrades that require fuel.
***Gardening.*** Gardening allows the crew to grow plants, typically for medicine or food, on the ship. This halves the crew's lifestyle expenses if they have a doctor on board.
***Lift Off.*** Lift Off allows the ship to take flight at a great cost of fuel. Upon activation, it enables the ship to fly at a speed equal to the movement speed of the ship.
***Lightweight.*** This makes the ship nimble and light, allowing it to travel in shallow water and sail upon the clouds of sky islands.
***Reverse.*** This upgrade allows the ship to move in a straight line backward by expending fuel.
