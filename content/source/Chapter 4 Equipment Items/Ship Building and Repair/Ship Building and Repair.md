## Ship Building and Repair

Most renowned pirate crews have signature ships unique in their design. These are ships that have been either built or upgraded by the hands of a skilled shipwright.
The difference between a crew with and without a skilled shipwright is clear as day from a glance at their ship. Strengthened hulls, heavier cannons, and propulsion systems mark a vessel in the care of a skilled shipwright with the proper means to work with and can make the difference between life and death on the open seas.
