### Building a Ship

A shipwright does not need to bargain with others to get a ship up and running for their allies. All shipwrights know necessary to craft a seafaring vessel from scratch, what they need is the resources and manpower. To begin the construction of a ship, the crew must have at least one shipwright as part of their crew. However, other participants in the crafting process do not need to be shipwrights.
Building your ship is a time-consuming effort. To build a ship, you need resources such as wood, iron, and cloth of a value equal to the market value of the ship you are attempting to build. So if you for instance are attempting to build a caravel, you would need 100 million berries worth of resources, though the cost and time may be reduced through certain abilities that reduce crafting time and cost such as the shipwright's Craft Vessel feature.
The crafting process begins with choosing the type of ship you wish create. Each ship has a fixed time associated with crafting. For example, a rowboat is considerably faster to craft than a sloop. The time to craft each ship is described in the Crafting Time table below. The times listed are the amount of work days required to craft the ship, each day takes about 8 hours, though the DM may adjust the time and costs for the crafting if need be, such as accounting for new materials or extra assistance at a greater cost.
##### Crafting Time
| Ship Type | Estimated Time |
|:----:|:----------:|
| Rowboat | 10 Days |
| Keelboat | 90 Days |
| Sloop | 180 Days |
| Longship | 360 Days |
| Caravel | 440 Days |
| Carrack | 720 Days |
| Galley | 720 Days |
| Galleon | 720 Days |
After choosing the ship, the person leading the ship's creation, typically the shipwright, making a single crafting check using a set of relevant set of tools (such as carpenter's or smith's tools), or an Intelligence (Engineering) check, but the DCs are increased by 5. This check determines how efficently the ship is crafted, either faster or slower and more or less expensive than expected.
A poor roll is representative of issues and complications during construction, leading to some extra cost and time. A high roll is representative of an efficent use of time and materials during construction. The Crafting Process table below denotes the effects from the crafting check.
##### Crafting Process
| Crafting Check Result | Estimated Time and Cost |
|:----:|:-----------|
| 5 or lower  | The total time and cost to craft the ship is doubled. |
| 10  | The total time and cost to craft the ship is normal.  |
| 15 | The total cost is reduced by a quarter. |
| 20 | The total time and cost are reduced by a quarter. |
| 25 | The total time and cost are reduced by half. |
After rolling the check, the crew working on the ship's construction can choose to either initiate building the ship, or scrapping the idea entirely to start over.
Scrapping a ship takes a considerable amount of time and resources to complete, such as transportation and dispossal. The crew spends a quarter of the time and cost of the ship would have taken to start over.
If the crew does choose to go along with the construction they must provide the resources and spend each work day required, resulting in the ship being built once complete. The time doesn't need to be consecutive, and can be paused and resumed so long as the ship is not damaged. If a ship incurs significant damage during construction, a quarter of progress is lost, extending the total time and cost by a quarter.
If the shipwright had help from other creatures who are at least proficient in the relevant set of tools, the shipwright's crafting check gains a +1 bonus to their check, to a maximum equal to the shipwright's ability modifier for the crafting check. The help must be present during the construction process for the bonus to count.
