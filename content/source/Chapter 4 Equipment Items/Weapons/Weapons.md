## Weapons

Weapons exist in a wide variety of forms in the world of _One Piece_. This also introduces a few additional and modified properties on top of the ones presented in the _player's handbook_.
***Adaptable.*** Most weapons have various functions, some can slash just as well as they can stab. Weapons with the adaptable property are able to use any of the damage types listed in the parantheses next to the property. For example "Adaptible (B,S)" means the wielder can choose either bludgeoning or slashing when they make the attack. These damage types are usually the physical damage types of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, displayed as (B,P,S).
***Ammunition.*** All ranged weapons require their specified ammunition to fire. After an attack roll is made, the respective ammunition is expended. Bows and crossbows require arrows and bolts, and firearms use firearm bullets.
***Heavy.*** In this system, weapons with the heavy property can be wielded by any creature. When a creature uses the weapon to make a shove attempt and succeeds, the target is knocked back an additional 5ft.
***Reload.*** All firearms have a specific reload score as well. This counts how many times the firearm can be used to attack before requiring it to be reloaded. Reloading a firearm typically takes an action, or if you have multiattack, one of your attack actions. Certain features may even allow you to use a bonus action.
***Strong.*** A feature of any bow is its versatile nature, the user either using deft aim or their strength the pull the string farther back. When making an attack with a strong ranged weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
