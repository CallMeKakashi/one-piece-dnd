### Additional Melee Weapons

A few additional melee weapons are also introduced in the setting, as they see prevalent use around the world, some boasting an almost mythical status.
***Cutlass.*** Typically featuring a basket hilt and a curved, single-edged blade, these swords trade some of the lightness of a scimitar for more stopping power. A pirate favorite.
***Katana.*** Originating from Wano, katana are popular weapons among swordsmen and marine officers. Less bulky than double-edged longswords but also less durable. The slender blade makes it possible to wield them with speed over power.
***Manacles.*** A set of metal shackes meant to keep a small or medium from using their hands. While not traditionally a weapon in 5e, they operate similar enough to nets to be put here. Much like nets, manacles deal no damage when they strike, instead they inflict the effect of their special property.
After making a successful hit against a creature with hands within 5ft, the attack deals no damage, instead the target suffers the following:
While in manacles, a creature cannot benefit from shields, cannot use creations that require somatic components, and have disadvantage on all weapon attacks made using their hands.
Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 20 hit points, and an AC of 19.
While manacles are locked onto a creature, its special property cannot be used until it is unlocked.
***Odachi.*** Like katana, these two-handed blades originate from Wano. With long and slender blades, they sacrifice weight and stopping power for agility and flexibility.
