### Additional Ranged Weapons

There are several additional and adjusted weapons used by players and NPCs alike. These include firearms such as muskets, shotguns, and even nets.
***Musket.*** A simple, muzzle-loaded rifle typically made out of steel or brass that fires small lead balls in a hail, much like a predecessor to the shotgun. Its ammunition type and flared muzzle make its relatively short range, but it can be deadly in close-quarters combat.
***Flintlock.*** The most common gun found on the seas due to being relatively cheap and easy to mass produce, flintlock are single shot pistols with short effective range. Rain and weather have a severe effect on the weapon's reliability, meaning it is typically used only by those that can't afford better firearms.
***Shotgun.*** The mighty and personal shotgun, known for causing vast damage in close proximity despite being a ranged weapon. This firearm fires off several bullets in the form of shells that blast holes in any surface. Less common and more costly, but all the more effective when it comes to making things go boom.
The shotgun has a special property in which attacks made with the ranged weapon don't have disadvantage within close range. Additionally, range attacks against creatures within the short range of the weapon, deal an extra 1d4 piercing damage.
***Net.*** A standard set of knotted ropes to ensnare the target. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.
In addition, the net has a special property in which attacks made with it don't have disadvantage within close range.
***Rifle.*** Rifles in the world of _One Piece_ are outfitted with a percussion cap rather than a flintlock mechanism, making them more reliable to use. The rifles presented here are outfitted with a revolving chamber, allowing repeating shots to be taken before needing to be reloaded. This weapon is typically used by marine soldiers.
***Pistol.*** Much like muskets, pistols use a percussion cap and typically have an extended chamber for ammunition as well, making them more versatile than flintlocks in return for being much more expensive to produce. It is the typical sidearm of most marine soldiers.
***Revolver.*** The most modern weapon design, revolvers are repeating handguns equipped with a revolving chamber, making them very useful for firing multiple rounds in quick succession. The design includes rifled barrels and double action operation, making them superior to common pistols but much more expensive to develop.
