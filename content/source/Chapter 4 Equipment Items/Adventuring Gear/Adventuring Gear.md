## Adventuring Gear

This section describes items unique to the setting, using their mechanics and special rules.
***Firearms Bullets.*** Iron or lead balls used as ammunition in the pistol, flintlock, musket, rifle, shotgun, and revolver.
***Apparatus.*** An apparatus is a mechanism or item of some sort that allows gadgeteers to create fantastic effects, such as dials from the sky islands or an experimental rod with sprockets and gyri attached to it.
***Log pose.*** In the Grand Line, compasses do not work because of the strong magnetic fields surrounding each island. A log pose is required to make navigation rolls at all while in the Grand Line, otherwise, you're sailing blindly.
***Preservation Box.*** A massive iron box filled with ice or other coolants, and tightly insulated from the elements. Helps keep fresh produce or medicine from spoiling on long trips, allowing crews to enjoy better and healthier food and medical treatment on their travels.
***Sea Charts.*** Sea charts map the nearby island as well as water depth and land elevations. While a navigator has sea charts at hand, it makes all navigation checks an advantage while within the area.
