## Expenses

Life on the seas is one of freedom from law and social classes, however, it is not freedom from the need to eat and sleep. As long as you have the food, water, and living space to suffice for long trips, travel from island to island can be a pleasant cruise disregarding any unforeseen setbacks.
Before you set off on the seas with a ship, it is important to note how many provisions you have stocked for the journey. These provisions entail more than simple rations, including cooked food, fresh water, comfortable living quarters, and any utilities or specific consumables a crew might need on their trip, such as lemons to counteract scurvy. Simply calculate the number of days you aim to spend at sea and then multiply it by the amount of beri required to maintain a specific lifestyle for that time. It's generally a good idea to stock a little extra, as the seas are uncertain especially so in the Grand Line. Typically, this duty falls on the ship's cook.
For instance, if it will take 7 days to travel from one island to the next and you aim to maintain a modest lifestyle (10 000 beri per day) for a crew of 5 people, you will need 350 000 beri worth of provisions to last you the entire trip.
