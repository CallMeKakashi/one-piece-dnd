### Treasure and Loot

Finding treasure and loot is, to many pirates, the very reason for their existence. Even those who seek freedom and adventure alone typically come upon some kind of treasure on their travel. Though the luster of gemstones and the glitter of gold attract the eye, they cannot fill one's belly. As such, trading in treasure for money is often as vital as finding it to begin with.
***Weapons, Armor, and other Equipment.*** Typically, weapons and armor you find as treasure or loot aren't in tip-top condition, and selling it typically only nets you half of the market value. Rare and unique finds can however be worth more than a chest full of gold, especially if it is a weapon with a history. Conversely, weapons and armor damaged by battle typically aren't worth much except as scrap metal.
***Gems, Jewelry, and Art Pieces.*** These types of items retain their full value when sold, making them the most valuable form of treasure in terms of monetary value. Exceptionally rare or unique pieces might be difficult to sell, however, and not every merchant is scrupulous enough to offer a fair deal.
***Trade Goods.*** While not as exciting as chests of gold and silver, sacks full of wheat and barrels of salt and freshwater are just as valuable if not more to traveling pirates, and oftentimes much easier to come upon. Most smaller towns trade in these wares more often than they use monetary transactions, and like gems and art pieces they retain their full market value when sold.
***Treasure Maps and Sea Charts.*** Tales of buried treasure left behind by legendary pirates are abundant all across the four seas, and even a fake map can sometimes be treated like the treasure itself. Likewise, mundane maps and sea charts of distant islands or dangerous waters are invaluable to most seafarers, causing these items to maintain their full market value as well.
