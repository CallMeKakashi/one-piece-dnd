## Wealth

The main currency in the world of _One Piece_ is known as Beri (sometimes spelled as Beli, Berry, or Belly). It most commonly occurs in paper form, though coins do exist, and have no fractional unit. As such, Beri prices tend to be in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands for most adventuring gear, with a low-quality sword costing the aspiring swordsman around 50 000 beri.
The exchange rate between beri and regular Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition currency can be calculated from the idea that 1 beri = 1 copper coin. However, in order to have the prices check out as you scale up the coinage, the exchange rate between coins I made tenfold the standard value, as described below.
##### Beri Exchange Rate
| Coin | Beri Equivalent |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Copper (cp)  | 1 Beri |
| Silver (sp)  | 100 Beri |
| Gold (gp) | 10 000 Beri |
