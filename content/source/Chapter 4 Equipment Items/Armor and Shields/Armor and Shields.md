## Armor and Shields

In the world of _One Piece_, protection from all manners of harm is paramount for most adventurers. However, few pirates would consider taking to the seas in full plate armor, given the difficulty of swimming when clad in suits of steel and metal. The use of lighter armor is more widespread, not to mention more commonly available. Some additional forms of armor exist in this setting.
***Navy Uniform.*** The navy standard uniform is made from durable cloth capable of surviving the harsh seas, though not directly designed for close-quarters combat.
***Light Longcoat.*** Longcoats are primarily made out of sturdy cloth and leather, made for comfort and ease of movement over protection. Favored by marines, each soldier earns a long coat when they reach ensign rank or higher.
***Heavy Longcoat.*** These longcoats are made out of thick hides or leather interlocked with pieces of metal or boiled leather for extra protection, often accompanied by ammunition belts and knife straps. Popular among pirates for the balance between protection and versatility.
