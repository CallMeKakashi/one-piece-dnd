### Transponder Snails

Transponder snails are a unique genus of snails with the ability to communicate with each other through telepathy, capable of using electronic signals to reach across great distances. Coupled with their ability to perfectly mimic human speech and even expressions, they have been domesticated for use as phones across the world. These snails are also referred to as "den den mushi".
Older transponder snails are typically as big as a domestic cat, while baby transponder snails are small enough to fit in a hand, allowing them to act as mobile devices. Transponder snails are typically docile by nature and do not mind being domesticated, as it provides a source of food and safety. The attachments necessary to use them for communication also does not cause them particular harm or discomfort.
Common transponder snails are typically used only by government officials and wealthy pirate captains with the means to procure one. They are typically not used by the normal citizen, though they become more common throughout the Grand Line, especially in the New World.
Other forms of transponder snails do exist but are extremely rare. Visual transponder snails are used widely by the world government but are mostly unheard of elsewhere.
***Black Transponder Snails.*** Typically only used by marines, black transponder snails are a subspecies that remain small for life. Typically small enough to be fitted to one's wrist, these transponder snails pick up and eavesdrop on other forms of transponder snails, allowing the user to listen in on conversations between other transponder snails.
***Cameko Transponder Snails.*** can store images and videos. It is a younger visual transponder snail. While taking a photo, it creates flashes of light with its eyes to perform flash photography. It is usually outfitted with an antenna connected to the shell, that allows it to send signals and live video feeds to its connected proko.

***Horned Transponder Snails.*** These transponder snails do not receive signals for communication, instead, they broadcast signals that intercept other transponder snails, making it impossible to use them in their vicinity. Typically used by pirates who wish to hold meetings in secret.
***Proko Transponder Snails.*** This subspecies of transponder snails can receive, project and broadcast what a cameko subspecies sees onto a bigger video screen. It is an older visual transponder snail. They can broadcast their frequencies between two relatively close locations.
***Surveillance Transponder Snails.*** An adult form of the cameko transponder snail. Too big to be kept and moved around by hand, these transponder snails can be placed strategically to survey an area. Multiple surveillance transponder snails can broadcast their sight to a single proko, allowing an effective network to be set up with enough funds. Typically only important government facilities employ this level of surveillance.
