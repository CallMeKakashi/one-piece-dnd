## Tools

A few additional tools appear in this setting, using their own mechanics and special rules as well.
***Appraiser's Tools.*** A tool kit consisting of a magnifying glass, reference material, a small hammer, and scales with which to weigh small items. It's useful for establishing the proper value of bounty and loots you find on your travels.
***Dial Kit.*** A set of tools containing everything a tinkerer needs to repair and prepare dials, described later in the chapter. With a dial kit, you can repair cracked dials or identify different types of dials and their uses. You also need this to repair broken skyborne vehicles.
***Sky Vehicles.*** On sky islands, dials are used in place of common watercrafts. Typically crafted from wood with breath dials attached to them, skyborne vehicles can race across clouds and water at great speeds. These kinds of vehicles come in three distinct forms: Surfers, shooters, and wavers.
Surfers superficially resemble regular surfing boards, however, they have a set of breath dials attached to the back end or sides which serve to propel the board without the need for wind or waves. It is the middle ground for sky vehicles, faster than skates but more nimble and lighter than a waver.
Shooters have a similar shape to ice skates that are attached to feet or footwear, however with a broader and dull blade. Breath dials attached to them allow the wearer to travel over water and clouds with practice. The most agile of all-sky vehicles, the shooters are difficult to master but rewarding as they carry next to no bulk.
The largest of the sky vehicles, the waver resembles a water scooter and functions practically the same, using a larger breath dial (or, in the case of rare antiques, jet dial) as an engine. By far the fastest of the three sky vehicles, it can easily overwhelm the non-proficient user due to its fast acceleration.
