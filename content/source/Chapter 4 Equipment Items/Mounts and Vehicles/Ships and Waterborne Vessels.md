### Ships and Waterborne Vessels

No pirate crew worth their salt can even call themselves a crew unless they have a ship of their own. Whether it's a humble keelboat or a massive galleon, a crew's ship is their heart without which they cannot even leave the harbor behind. Most crews start humbly with a simple rowboat or keelboat, but to cross reverse mountain into the Grand Line, they must find the means to acquire a proper ship first and establish enough of a crew to sail it.
***Caravel.*** Caravels are sailing ships distinguished by their lateen sails and 2 or more masts. Light and fast, caravels make for excellent expeditionary ships and can be manned by a small crew. In this setting, a caravel specifically refers to a smaller sailing vessel of its type.
***Carrack.*** Carracks are caravel-built ships with 3 to 4 masts and both lateen and square-rigged sails, and predecessors to the galleon. In this setting, carrack refers to a caravel-built warship. It is specifically favored among pirates and marines.
***Galleon.*** The largest available ships in the setting, galleons are multi-decked sailing ships that can easily be outfitted and repurposed as warships. Typically the flagships of any fleet, a galleon can hold a big crew and plenty of cargo, while retaining better maneuverability than a carrack.
***Galley.*** Galleys are long vessels that rely on sails and sizable rowing crews to move. These ships can carry siege weapons and soldiers to war or transport large amounts of cargo for merchants. However, their reliance on manpower for their speed means they cannot carry heavy weaponry for use, making them less useful in naval warfare.
***Longship.*** Longships are vessels that rely on a rowing crew and sails to move across the sea, often outfitted with a single full-rigged mast. The size of a longship makes it easy for troops to get on and off quickly, making it the perfect ship for engaging in surprise strikes. Typically only used by giants in this setting.
***Keelboat.*** One of the smallest sailing vessels, keelboats can be sailed or rowed by a single person. These ships often transport small amounts of cargo or passengers. They're perfect for pleasure cruises, as they're easier and less expensive to operate than larger vessels.
***Rowboat.*** The humble rowboat serves to ferry passengers back and forth from larger ships or to navigate lakes and rivers. Due to its simple, versatile design, a rowboat has no decks or typical crew. Weighing 100 pounds, a rowboat is easy to transport and might be carried by larger ships.
***Sloop.*** A small, nimble, and agile sailing vessel with a single mast and for-and-aft-rigged sails. A sloop in this setting refers to smaller boats and not a sloop-of-war. Its small size makes it easy to maneuver, oftentimes being a prime choice for pirate crews who only just began their journey.
