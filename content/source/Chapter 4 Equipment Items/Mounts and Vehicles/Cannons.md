### Cannons

In naval battles, cannons serve as the primary weapon of most all seafaring vessels. A cannon's destructive properties are measured by the pound rating of the ammunition it fires: The larger the pound rating, the more damage the cannon deals on a successful hit. However, cannons are heavy-duty equipment, and larger cannons typically can't be mounted on smaller vessels at all. Furthermore, the size of the vessel determines how many cannons can even fit on the ship to begin with, regardless of weight and size.
***Damage.*** All cannons deal bludgeoning damage with basic round shots, however different forms of ammunition exist. See the Cannon Shot table for more information.
***Clean and Reload.*** Smaller guns, such as the swivel gun, can be effectively manned and used by a single person, however, larger cannons typically require a group of two to three to fire effectively each turn.
***Ship Availability.*** Some ships are better designed to handle the weight and recoil of cannons than others. If a ship fires a cannon for which it isn't designed, such as a caravel loading and firing a 24-pounder cannon, then the ship takes bludgeoning damage equal to the average damage of the cannon whenever it is fired (in this case, that would result in 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage.)
***Damage Spread.*** A shot type's damage spread determines the splash zone resulting from a hit. Sphere-shaped spreads extend from the shot's impact, while cone and line-shaped spreads extend from the muzzle of the cannon. If the damage shape is in a line, the length of the line equals the cannon's normal range.
If the targeted creature is hit, each creature, that is not the target but are within the damage spread when the cannon is fired, must make a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes all of the cannon's damage roll on a failed to save, and half damage on a successful one. So in theory, it is possible to parry a cannonball to save yourself and the area and creatures around it if you are the target of the cannon.
***Firing a Cannon.*** When you fire a cannon, you make a ranged attack roll with the cannon as normal, using your Dexterity modifier. Unless you have proficiency with cannons, you do not add your proficiency modifier to attacks with them.
**Ranged Cannon Attack =** d20 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
**Cannon Save DC =** 8 + number of damage dice of the cannon
